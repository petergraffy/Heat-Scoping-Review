Method: We collected daily ambient temperature and mortality and defined 2 types of heatwaves by combining daily temperature 90th in each month of the study period or since 30 years with duration 2 and 3 days. We used a distributed lag non-linear model to study the association between each type of heatwave definition, and deaths due to non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory causes with lags up to 13 days. Results: There was no discernible correlation in this area, despite the fact that heatwaves raised the risk of death from cardiovascular causes and lowered the risk from respiratory causes. On the other hand, the risk of total non-accidental mortality on days with the heatwaves is significantly higher than normal days. In main effects, the heatwaves have a significant relationship with the risk of total non-accidental mortality (in the first heatwave definition, Cumulative Excess Risk (CER) in lag<sub>0-2</sub> was 10.4 and in second heatwave definition, CER values in lag<sub>0, 0-2, and 0-6</sub> were 12.4, 29.2, and 38.8 respectively). Also, in added effects, heatwaves have a significant relationship with the risk of total non-accidental mortality (in the first heatwave definition, CER in lag<sub>0 and 0-2</sub> were 1.79 and 4.11 and in the second heatwave definition, CER values in lag<sub>0, 0-2, and 0-6</sub> were 7.76, 18.35 and 24.87 respectively). In addition, heatwaves appeared to contribute to a cumulative excess risk of non-accidental death among the male group as well as the older adults. Conclusion: However, the results showed that heatwaves could have detrimental effects on health, even in populations accustomed to the extreme heat. Therefore, early warning systems which monitor heatwaves should provide the necessary warnings to the population, especially the most vulnerable groups.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Maxime,10.1177/11786302231151538,Iran,,

Methods: We performed a time-stratified case-crossover study to assess the acute effects of heatwaves on selected morbidities in primary care settings in Flanders, Belgium, between 2000 and 2015. We used conditional logistic regression models. We assessed the effect of heatwaves on the day of the event (lag 0) and X days earlier (lags 1 to X). The associations are presented as Incidence Density Ratios (IDR). Results: We included 22,344 events. Heatwaves are associated with increased heat-related morbidities such as heat stroke IDR 3.93 [2.94-5.26] at lag 0, dehydration IDR 3.93 [2.94-5.26] at lag 1, and orthostatic hypotension IDR 2.06 [1.37-3.10] at lag 1. For cardiovascular morbidities studied, there was only an increased risk of stroke at lag 3 IDR 1.45 [1.04-2.03]. There is no significant association with myocardial ischemia/infarction or arrhythmia. Heatwaves are associated with decreased respiratory infection risk. The IDR for upper respiratory infections is 0.82 [0.78-0.87] lag 1 and lower respiratory infections (LRI) is 0.82 [0.74-0.91] at lag 1. There was no significant effect modification by age or premorbid chronic disease (diabetes, hypertesnsion).

METHODS: Heat waves were defined as >= 2 days with temperature >= 95th percentile for the community for 1 May through 30 September.

With climate change predictions of more frequent and more intense heat waves, it is of paramount importance to quantify the health risks related to heat, especially for the most vulnerable. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases associated with outdoor heat in the U.S. elderly. METHODS: An observational study of approximately 12.5 million Medicare beneficiaries in 213 United States counties, January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008. We estimate a national average relative risk of hospitalization for each 10degreeF (5.6degreeC) increase in daily outdoor temperature using Bayesian hierarchical models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We obtained daily county-level rates of Medicare emergency respiratory hospitalizations (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 464-466, 480-487, 490-492) in 213 U.S. counties from 1999 through 2008. Overall, each 10degreeF increase in daily temperature was associated with a 4.3% increase in same-day emergency hospitalizations for respiratory diseases (95% posterior interval, 3.8, 4.8%). Counties' relative risks were significantly higher in counties with cooler average summer temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence of an association between outdoor heat and respiratory hospitalizations in the largest population of elderly studied to date. Given projections of increasing temperatures from climate change and the increasing global prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease, the relationship between heat and respiratory morbidity is a growing concern.","Anderson, G Brooke     Dominici, Francesca     Wang, Yun     McCormack, Meredith C     Bell, Michelle L     Peng, Roger D     eng     P01ES018176/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21 ES022585/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21 ES021427/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     K23 ES016819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01ES012054/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21 ES020152/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01 ES019560/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21ES021427/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01ES015028/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01 ES012054/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21ES020152/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     K23ES016819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01ES019560/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R01 ES015028/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     P01 ES018176/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.     2013/03/16     Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2013 May 15;187(10):1098-103. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201211-1969OC. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",10.1164/rccm.201211-1969OC,"Age Distribution;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Bayes Theorem;*Emergency Medical Services/mt [Methods];Emergency Medical Services/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];Female;*Hospitalization/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Male;*Medicare;*Respiration Disorders/ep [Epidemiology];Risk;United States/ep [Epidemiology];Hot Temperature;Medicare;Emergencies",,

This raises the question of the degree to which lives are being shortened by exposure to heat or cold. Years of life lost (YLL) take into account population life expectancy and age at which mortality occurs. However, YLL are rarely used as an outcome-metric in studies of temperature-related mortality. This represents an important gap in knowledge; to better comprehend potential impacts of temperature in the context of climate change and an ageing population, it is important to understand the relationship between temperature and YLL, and also whether the risks of temperature related mortality and YLL have changed over recent years. Gridded temperature data derived from observations, and mortality data were provided by the UK Met Office and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), respectively. We derived YLL for each death using sex-specific yearly life expectancy from ONS English-national lifetables. We undertook an ecological time-series regression analysis, using a distributed-lag double-threshold model, to estimate the relationship between daily mean temperature and daily YLL and mortality between 1996 and 2013 in Greater London, the West Midlands including Birmingham, and Greater Manchester. Temperature-thresholds, as determined by model best fit, were set at the 91st (for heat-effects) and 35th (for cold-effects) percentiles of the mean temperature distribution. Secondly, we analysed whether there had been any changes in heat and cold related risk of YLL and mortality over time. Heat-effects (lag 0-2 days) were greatest in London, where for each 1 degreeC above the heat-threshold the risk of mortality increased by 3.9% (CI 3.5%, 4.3%) and YLL increased by 3.0% (2.5%, 3.5%). Between 1996 and 2013, the proportion of total deaths and YLL attributable to heat in London were 0.50% and 0.40% respectively. Cold-effects (lag 0-27 days) were greatest in the West Midlands, where for each 1 degreeC below the cold-threshold, risk of mortality increased by 3.1% (2.4%, 3.7%) and YLL also increased by 3.1% (2.2%, 3.9%). The proportion of deaths and YLL attributable to cold in the West Midlands were 3.3% and 3.2% respectively. We found no evidence of decreasing susceptibility to heat and cold over time. The addition of life expectancy information into calculations of temperature-related risk and mortality burdens for English cities is novel. We demonstrate that although older individuals are at greatest risk of temperature-related mortality, heat and cold still make a significant contribution to the YLL due to premature death.","Arbuthnott, Katherine     Hajat, Shakoor     Heaviside, Clare     Vardoulakis, Sotiris     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2020/08/11     Environ Int. 2020 Nov;144:105966. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2020.105966.

In this paper, studies which assess the direct impact of current increased temperatures and heat-waves on health and those which project future health impacts of heat under different climate change scenarios in the UK are reviewed. This review finds that all UK studies demonstrate an increase in heat-related mortality occurring at temperatures above threshold values, with respiratory deaths being more sensitive to heat than deaths from cardiovascular disease (although the burden from cardiovascular deaths is greater in absolute terms). The relationship between heat and other health outcomes such as hospital admissions, myocardial infarctions and birth outcomes is less consistent. We highlight the main populations who are vulnerable to heat. Within the UK, these are older populations, those with certain co-morbidities and those living in Greater London, the South East and Eastern regions. In all assessments of heat-related impacts using different climate change scenarios, deaths are expected to increase due to hotter temperatures, with some studies demonstrating that an increase in the elderly population will also amplify burdens. However, key gaps in knowledge are found in relation to how urbanisation and population adaptation to heat will affect health impacts, and in relation to current and future strategies for effective, sustainable and equitable adaptation to heat.

Linear regression methods alongside high-dimensional fixed effects are used to minimize confounding variation. Analysis is conducted with special emphasis on the elderly population, as well as on specific elderly risk groups identified in previous literature. We show that for an additional day per month above 25degreeC, monthly all-cause mortality increases by 1.5 percent (95% CI: 0.4%-2.6%) and acute hospital visits increase by 1.1 percent (95% CI: 0.7%-1.6%).

METHODS: We performed a case-crossover analysis of 5,047 stillbirths in the province of Quebec, Canada, between the months of April and September from 1981-2011. We obtained maximum daily temperatures from Environment Canada. We estimated the association (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, CI) between maximum daily temperature and stillbirth adjusted for relative humidity, comparing temperature on the day of death with nearby days. We modeled temperature continuously using splines, with 20°C as the reference. The main outcome measure was stillbirth according to week of gestation (preterm, term), and cause of death (undetermined, maternal complications, placenta/cord/membranes, birth asphyxia, congenital anomaly, other). RESULTS: Elevated outdoor temperatures were positively associated with stillbirth at term, but not preterm. Maximum daily temperatures of 30°C the day before death were associated with 1.22 times greater odds of term stillbirth relative to 20°C (95% CI 1.02-1.46), and associations increased progressively with higher temperatures. Outdoor temperature was associated with stillbirth due to maternal complications and undetermined causes, but not other causes. Compared with 20°C, maximum temperatures of 30°C were associated with 1.72 times the odds of stillbirth due to maternal complications (95% CI 1.06-2.80) and 1.28 time the odds of stillbirth due to undetermined causes (95% CI 1.02-1.59). For both maternal complications and undetermined causes, the associations strengthened progressively with higher temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated outdoor temperature maybe a novel risk factor for stillbirth, especially at term, and for stillbirths related to maternal complications or with undetermined cause. As global temperatures rise, further investigation is warranted to study how heat stress affects the health of pregnant women in temperate climates.",Suppl. 1     Dh6cs     T-274     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 | RAYYAN-LABELS: Maxime,10.1177/1933719116641257,risk;stillbirth;society;gynecological examination;heat;temperature;Canada;pregnant woman;female;death;human;risk factor;cause of death;environment;health;heat stress;congenital malformation;Canadian;perinatal asphyxia;pregnancy;humidity;confidence interval;climate;Hot Temperature;Extreme Heat,,

We examined the association between heat and risk of delivery among preterm and term pregnancies with the use of a time-to-event design to minimize bias from seasonal variation in conception rates. METHODS: We used data on 206,929 term and 12,390 preterm singleton live births for Montreal, Canada, from June through September, 1981-2010. The exposure variables were (1) maximum daily temperatures in the week preceding birth and (2) number of consecutive days with temperatures of 32degreeC or above during the preceding week. We estimated hazards of delivery among preterm (<37 gestational weeks), early-term (37-38 weeks), and full-term (>=39 weeks) pregnancies for both exposures in Cox regression models, adjusting for maternal characteristics. Sensitivity analyses were carried out adjusting for markers of air pollution. RESULTS: Maximum temperatures reached at least 32degreeC during the preceding week for 19,829 births (9.0%). Relative to a maximum of 20degreeC, the hazard of delivery within term was 4% higher for maximum temperatures of 32degreeC or higher, but no association was found for preterm delivery. Associations were stronger with early-term than with full-term delivery. Extreme heat episodes with 4 to 7 days of maximum temperature of at least 32degreeC were associated with a 27% greater hazard of delivery among early-term pregnancies relative to other days. CONCLUSION: High ambient temperature and extreme heat episodes may trigger earlier delivery among term births.","Auger, Nathalie     Naimi, Ashley I     Smargiassi, Audrey     Lo, Ernest     Kosatsky, Tom     eng     Comparative Study     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2014/03/07     Epidemiology. 2014 May;25(3):344-50. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000074. | RAYYAN-LABELS: Maxime",10.1097/EDE.0000000000000074,"Adult;British Columbia;Confidence Intervals;Databases, Factual;*Extreme Heat/ae [Adverse Effects];Female;Gestational Age;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Infant, Premature;Male;Pregnancy;*Premature Birth/ep [Epidemiology];Proportional Hazards Models;Regression Analysis;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;*Seasons;*Term Birth;Young Adult;Extreme Heat;Hot Temperature",,

Our objective was to determine the relationship between acute exposure to high outdoor temperature and risk of retinal detachment. Materials and methods We analysed 14,302 individuals with inpatient procedures for retinal detachment from April through September between 2006 and 2013 in the province of Quebec, Canada. Using a time-stratified case-crossover study design, we examined the association of retinal detachment with outdoor summer temperature the preceding week. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mean weekly temperature according to subtypes of retinal detachment (traction, serous, rhegmatogenous, breaks), and assessed associations by age and sex. Results Exposure to elevated temperature the preceding week was associated with a higher likelihood of traction detachment, but not other forms of retinal detachment. Associations were stronger at <75 years of age in both men and women. Relative to 15 °C, a mean weekly temperature of 25 °C was associated with an OR for traction detachment of 2.71 (95% CI 1.56–4.71) before 55 years, 2.73 (95% CI 1.61–4.64) at 55–64 years, and 1.98 (95% CI 1.30–3.02) at 64–75 years. Discussion Elevated outdoor temperatures may be associated with an increased risk of traction retinal detachment. In light of climate change, a better understanding of the impact of heat waves on the eye and other sensory organs is needed.","Auger, Nathalie     Rheaume, Marc-Andre     Bilodeau-Bertrand, Marianne     Tang, Tina     Kosatsky, Tom     eng     MOP-142277/CIHR/Canada     Multicenter Study     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2017/05/27     Environ Res. 2017 Aug;157:103-109. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2017.05.017.

The association between temperature and morbidity (most commonly represented by hospital admissions) has been documented mainly in developed countries. Little is known about patterns in China; nor have the health effects of temperature variations been closely studied in highland areas, worldwide. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the temperature-morbidity association in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, using sex- and age-specific hospitalizations, excluding those due to external causes. METHODS: A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the nonlinear and delayed effects of temperature on morbidity (including total emergency room visits, total and cause-specific hospital admissions, sex- and age-specific non-external admissions). RESULTS: High temperatures are associated with increases in morbidity, to a greater extent than low temperatures. Lag effects of high and low temperatures were cause-specific. The relative risks (RR) of high temperature for total emergency room visits and non-external hospitalizations were 1.162 (95% CI: 1.002-1.349) and 1.161 (95% CI: 1.007-1.339) respectively, for lag 0-14 days. The strongest cumulative effect of heat for lag 0-27 days was on admissions for infectious diseases (RR: 2.067, 95% CI: 1.026-4.027). Acute heat effects at lag 0 were related with increases of renal (RR: 1.478, 95% CI: 1.005-2.174) and respiratory diseases (RR: 1.119, 95% CI: 1.010-1.240), whereas immediate cold effects increased admission for digestive diseases (RR: 1.132, 95% CI: 1.002-1.282). Those >=65 years of age and males were more vulnerable to high temperatures. CONCLUSION: We provide a first look at the temperature-morbidity relationship in Tibet. Exposure to both hot and cold temperatures resulted in increased admissions to hospital, but the immediate causes varied. We suggest that initiatives should be taken to reduce the adverse effects of temperature extremes in Tibet.","Bai, Li     Cirendunzhu     Woodward, Alistair     Dawa     Zhaxisangmu     Chen, Bin     Liu, Qiyong     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2014/06/08     Sci Total Environ. 2014 Aug 15;490:838-48. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.05.024.

The California Department of Public Health provided birth certificate data, while meteorological data came from the California Irrigation Management Information System, US Environmental Protection Agency, and National Centers for Environmental Information. After considering several temperature metrics, we observed the best model fit for term LBW over the full gestation (per 10-degrees-Fahrenheit (degreeF) increase in apparent temperature, 13.0% change, 95% confidence interval: 4.1, 22.7) above 55degreeF, and the greatest association was for third-trimester exposure above 60degreeF (15.8%, 95% confidence interval: 5.0, 27.6). Apparent temperature during the first month of pregnancy exhibited no significant risk, while the first trimester had a significantly negative association, and second trimester, last month, and last 2 weeks had slightly increased risks.

Identifying susceptible populations is of particular importance given anticipated rising temperatures from climatic change. METHODS: We investigated heat-related mortality for three Latin American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile) using a case-crossover approach for 754 291 deaths from 1998 to 2002. We considered lagged exposures, confounding by air pollution, cause of death and susceptibilities by educational attainment, age and sex. RESULTS: Same and previous day apparent temperature were most strongly associated with mortality risk. Effect estimates remained positive though lowered after adjustment for ozone or PM(10). Susceptibility increased with age in all cities. The increase in mortality risk for those >or=65 comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of same-day apparent temperature was 2.69% (95% CI: -2.06 to 7.88%) for Santiago, 6.51% (95% CI: 3.57-9.52%) for Sao Paulo and 3.22% (95% CI: 0.93-5.57%) for Mexico City. Patterns of vulnerability by education and sex differed across communities. Effect estimates were higher for women than men in Mexico City, and higher for men elsewhere, although results by sex were not appreciably different for any city. In Sao Paulo, those with less education were more susceptible, whereas no distinct patterns by education were observed in the other cities.

We aimed to provide a systematic assessment of the epidemiologic evidence regarding vulnerability to heat-related mortality. METHODS: Studies assessing the association between high ambient temperature or heat waves and mortality among different subgroups and published between January 1980 and August 2014 were selected. Estimates of association for all the included subgroups were extracted. We assessed the presence of heterogeneous effects between subgroups conducting Cochran Q tests. We conducted random effect meta-analyses of ratios of relative risks (RRR) for high ambient temperature studies. We performed random effects meta-regression analyses to investigate factors associated with the magnitude of the RRR. RESULTS: Sixty-one studies were included. Using the Cochran Q test, we consistently found evidence of vulnerability for the elderly ages >85 years. We found a pooled RRR of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97, 1.01) for male sex, 1.02 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.03) for age >65 years, 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.07) for ages >75 years, 1.03 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.05) for low individual socioeconomic status (SES), and 1.01 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.02) for low ecologic SES.

Understanding spatial heterogeneity at a fine spatial scale in relation to heat and related mortality is central to target interventions towards vulnerable communities. OBJECTIVES: To determine the spatial variability of heat-wave-related mortality risk among elderly in Paris, France at the census block level. We also aimed to assess area-level social and environmental determinants of high mortality risk within Paris. METHODS: We used daily mortality data from 2004 to 2009 among people aged >65 at the French census block level within Paris. We used two heat wave days' definitions that were compared to non-heat wave days. A Bernoulli cluster analysis method was applied to identify high risk clusters of mortality during heat waves. We performed random effects meta-regression analyses to investigate factors associated with the magnitude of the mortality risk. RESULTS: The spatial approach revealed a spatial aggregation of death cases during heat wave days. We found that small scale chronic PM<sub>10</sub> exposure was associated with a 0.02 (95% CI: 0.001; 0.045) increase of the risk of dying during a heat wave episode. We also found a positive association with the percentage of foreigners and the percentage of labor force, while the proportion of elderly people living in the neighborhood was negatively associated. We also found that green space density had a protective effect and inversely that the density of constructed feature increased the risk of dying during a heat wave episode. CONCLUSION: We showed that a spatial variation in terms of heat-related vulnerability exists within Paris and that it can be explained by some contextual factors. This study can be useful for designing interventions targeting more vulnerable areas and reduce the burden of heat waves.","Benmarhnia, Tarik     Kihal-Talantikite, Wahida     Ragettli, Martina S     Deguen, Severine     eng     Netherlands     2017/03/21     Sci Total Environ. 2017 Aug 15;592:288-294. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.102.

An increase in daily mortality has been observed in association with heat thermal stress and air pollution across many regions in the world, mainly in the northern hemisphere. The objective of the present study was to estimate the impact of heat on daily mortality in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, over a three-hot period (2005- 2007) using a time-series analysis while controlling for the effects of air pollution. We also explored the confounding and synergistic effect of temperature and air pollution on mortality. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS The temperature breakpoint above which mortality increases were estimated using a segmented linear regression. A Poisson Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model was then used to estimate the impact of heat on daily mortality. Potential confounders were pollutant, trend, calendar month, day of the week, the Ramadan period, and holidays. RESULTS: Over the three hot seasons studied, the temperature breakpoint was estimated at 27.4′XC ('b 4.6). After adjustment for potential confounders, the daily mortality increased significantly by 4.0% [95% confidence interval: 0.8-7.3] for a 1′XC increase in daily average temperature above the threshold. An increase of 10 mg/m3 in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was associated with a significant increase in daily mortality [0.5% (0.1-0.9)]. No significant interaction was found between different temperature variable and the pollution indicator considered. CONCLUSION This study highlights that heat can be a significant public health issue in countries with warm climates. Because North Africa is particularly vulnerable to heat waves, additional studies across this region are necessary to produce new insights to address this emerging threat under a changing climate.",Suppl. 1 Sp.

DESIGN: Case-crossover study. SETTING: England and Wales Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) database. PARTICIPANTS: 24,861 hospital admissions for myocardial infarction occurring in 11 conurbations during the warmest months (June to August) of the years 2003-09. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratio of myocardial infarction for a 1 degreeC increase in temperature. RESULTS: Strong evidence was found for an effect of heat acting 1-6 hours after exposure to temperatures above an estimated threshold of 20 degreeC (95% confidence interval 16 degreeC to 25 degreeC). For each 1 degreeC increase in temperature above this threshold, the risk of myocardial infarction increased by 1.9% (0.5% to 3.3%, P=0.009). Later reductions in risk seemed to offset early increases in risk: the cumulative effect of a 1 degreeC rise in temperature above the threshold was 0.2% (-2.1% to 2.5%) by the end of the third day after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ambient temperatures above a threshold of 20 degreeC seem to be associated with a transiently increased risk of myocardial infarction 1-6 hours after exposure. Reductions in risk at longer lags are consistent with heat triggering myocardial infarctions early in highly vulnerable people who would otherwise have had a myocardial infarction some time later (""short term displacement"").

OBJECTIVES: To identify possible causes of hospital admissions during extreme heat events and to estimate their risks using historical data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Matched analysis of time series data describing daily hospital admissions of Medicare enrollees (23.7 million fee-for-service beneficiaries [aged >=65 years] per year; 85% of all Medicare enrollees) for the period 1999 to 2010 in 1943 counties in the United States with at least 5 summers of near-complete (>95%) daily temperature data. EXPOSURES: Heat wave periods, defined as 2 or more consecutive days with temperatures exceeding the 99th percentile of county-specific daily temperatures, matched to non-heat wave periods by county and week. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily cause-specific hospitalization rates by principal discharge diagnosis codes, grouped into 283 disease categories using a validated approach. RESULTS: Risks of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infection, septicemia, and heat stroke were statistically significantly higher on heat wave days relative to matched non-heat wave days, but risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure was lower (P < .05). Relative risks for these disease groups were 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.25) for fluid and electrolyte disorders, 1.14 (95% CI, 1.06-1.23) for renal failure, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.16) for urinary tract infections, 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00-1.11) for septicemia, and 2.54 (95% CI, 2.14-3.01) for heat stroke. Absolute risk differences were 0.34 (95% CI, 0.22-0.46) excess admissions per 100,000 individuals at risk for fluid and electrolyte disorders, 0.25 (95% CI, 0.12-0.39) for renal failure, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.09-0.39) for urinary tract infections, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.01-0.41) for septicemia, and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.10-0.22) for heat stroke.

Such an effect is more evident in populations that are less prepared to cope with enhanced environmental temperatures. In this work, we extend our previous research on the link between climate change and Parkinson's disease (PD) to also include Alzheimer's Disease and other Dementias (AD/D) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neuron Diseases (ALS/MND). One hundred and eighty-four world countries were clustered into four groups according to their climate indices (warming and annual average temperature). Variations between 1990 and 2016 in the diseases' indices (prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years) and climate indices for the four clusters were analyzed. Unlike our previous work on PD, we did not find any significant correlation between warming and epidemiological indices for AD/D and ALS/MND patients. A significantly lower increment in prevalence in countries with higher temperatures was found for ALS/MND patients. It can be argued that the discordant findings between AD/D or ALS/MND and PD might be related to the different features of the neuronal types involved and the pathophysiology of thermoregulation. The neurons of AD/D and ALS/MND patients are less vulnerable to heat-related degeneration effects than PD patients.

During the hottest month of harvesting season, wet bulb globe temperature was collected in the work environment, and workloads observed, to assess heat stress. Urine samples for dehydration test, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature were measured pre- and post-shift to measure heat strain. Fluid intake and heat-related symptoms which subjects had experienced during the harvesting season were gathered via interviews at the end of the season. From the results, sugarcane cutters showed high risk for heat stress and strain, unlike factory workers who had low risk based on the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene (ACGIH) threshold limit values (TLVs) for heat stress. Dehydration was observed among sugarcane cutters and significant physiological changes including heart rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure occurred across the work shift. Significantly more sugarcane cutters reported experiencing heat-related symptoms including weakness/fatigue, heavy sweating, headache, rash, muscle cramp, dry mouth, dizziness, fever, dry/cracking skin, and swelling, compared to sugarcane factory workers.

Odds ratios (ORs) and information on study quality were abstracted by 2 investigators independently. Six case-control studies involving 1065 heat wave-related deaths were identified. RESULTS: Being confined to bed (OR, 6.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-9.2), not leaving home daily (OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.6-6.9), and being unable to care for oneself (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.8-4.8) were associated with the highest risk of death during heat waves. Preexisting psychiatric illness (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.3-9.8) tripled the risk of death, followed by cardiovascular (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.3-4.8) and pulmonary (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1) illness. Working home air-conditioning (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6), visiting cool environments (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5), and increasing social contact (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8) were strongly associated with better outcomes. Taking extra showers or baths (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1) and using fans (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) were associated with a trend toward lower risk of death. CONCLUSION: The present study identified several prognostic factors that could help to detect those individuals who are at highest risk during heat waves and to provide a basis for potential risk-reducing interventions in the setting of heat waves.

Associations between air temperature and mortality have been consistently observed; however, there is a lack of studies for Germany. Objectives. Our study investigated the association between short-term changes in air temperature and daily mortality in cities and administrative districts of Bavaria, Germany. Methods. Daily death counts for natural all-cause and cause-specific mortality as well as meteorological parameters were obtained from official agencies for the period 1990 to 2006 for the cities Munich, Nuremberg, and Augsburg and administrative districts Munich, Rosenheim, Augsburg, and Fürstenfeldbruck. The effects of two-day and 14-day average temperatures were estimated by Poisson semiparametric regression models controlling for time trend, season, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and other confounders if necessary. In a first step, models were estimated on city-specific levels. Exposure-response curves were then combined using a meta-smoothing approach. Lagged and cumulative effects of air temperature were also investigated by distributed lag non-linear models. Results. Overall, we observed a J-shaped exposure-response curve for two-day average temperature and all-cause mortality, with a threshold of 20° celsius. A 5°C increase of two-day average temperature above the threshold was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 1.015 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.009-1.020) in all-cause mortality. On the other hand, a 5°C decrease of 14-day average temperature was linearly associated with a RR of 1.038 (95%CI: 1.026-1.050). Conclusions. Both increases and decreases in air temperature were associated with an increased risk of mortality.

This study examined the association between daily air temperature and cause-specific mortality in Bavaria, Southern Germany. Moreover, we investigated effect modification by age and ambient air pollution. METHODS: We obtained data from Munich, Nuremberg as well as Augsburg, Germany, for the period 1990 to 2006. Data included daily cause-specific death counts, mean daily meteorology and air pollution concentrations (particulate matter with a diameter<10 mum [PM10] and maximum 8-h ozone). We used Poisson regression models combined with distributed lag non-linear models adjusting for long-term trend, calendar effects, and meteorological factors. Air pollutant concentrations were categorized into three levels, and an interaction term was included to quantify potential effect modification of the air temperature effects. RESULTS: The temperature-mortality relationships were non-linear for all cause-specific mortality categories showing U- or J-shaped curves. An increase from the 90th (20.0 degreeC) to the 99th percentile (24.8 degreeC) of 2-day average temperature led to an increase in non-accidental mortality by 11.4% (95% CI: 7.6%-15.3%), whereas a decrease from the 10th (-1.0 degreeC) to the 1st percentile (-7.5 degreeC) in the 15-day average temperature resulted in an increase of 6.2% (95% CI: 1.8%-10.8%). The very old were found to be most susceptible to heat effects. Results also suggested some effect modification by ozone, but not for PM10. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that both very low and very high air temperature increase cause-specific mortality in Bavaria. Results also pointed to the importance of considering effect modification by age and ozone in assessing temperature effects on mortality.","Breitner, Susanne     Wolf, Kathrin     Devlin, Robert B     Diaz-Sanchez, David     Peters, Annette     Schneider, Alexandra     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

There is also contrasting evidence of a seasonal increase in aortic ruptures related to atmospheric pressure, but an association with environmental temperature has never been formally modelled. METHODS: Using a prospective database, we identified 295 patients who were operated in a single centre for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in south-east Queensland between 1990 and 2010. We matched patients to their nearest weather station to estimate their exposure to temperature and air pressure in the days leading up to their rupture. We used the case-crossover method to estimate the risks of temperature, which we allowed to be non-linear (increased risks at high and low temperatures) and delayed by up to 25 days. RESULTS: There was an immediate increase in risk after exposure to cold, and a delayed risk after exposure to heat. An increased risk after exposure to high pressures disappeared after adjusting for temperature. At a mean temperature of 19degreeC (66degreeF), the odds ratio for rupture was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 2.76) compared with the reference temperature of 24degreeC. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between temperature and risk of aortic aneurysm rupture in the Southern Hemisphere. The physiological changes caused by thermoregulation may be a trigger for those people with a fragile aneurysm.","Brightwell, Robert E     Choong, Andrew M T L     Barnett, Adrian G     Walker, Philip J     eng     Australia     2014/10/29     ANZ J Surg. 2014 Nov;84(11):871-6. doi: 10.1111/ans.12446.

Psychiatric patients may be more vulnerable to high temperatures, which under current climate change projections will most likely increase the burden of this public health concern. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the short-term association between ambient temperature and mental health hospitalizations in Bern, Switzerland. METHODS: Daily hospitalizations for mental disorders between 1973 and 2017 were collected from the University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Bern. Population-weighted daily mean ambient temperatures were derived for the catchment area of the hospital from 2.3-km gridded weather maps. Conditional quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag linear models were applied to assess the association up to three days after the exposure. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, and subdiagnosis, and by subperiods (1973-1989 and 1990-2017). Additional subanalyses were performed to assess whether larger risks were found during the warm season or were due to heatwaves. RESULTS: The study included a total number of 88,996 hospitalizations. Overall, the hospitalization risk increased linearly by 4.0% (95% CI 2.0%, 7.0%) for every 10degreeC increase in mean daily temperature. No evidence of a nonlinear association or larger risks during the warm season or heatwaves was found. Similar estimates were found across for all sex and age categories, and larger risks were found for hospitalizations related to developmental disorders (29.0%; 95% CI 9.0%, 54.0%), schizophrenia (10.0%; 95% CI 4.0%, 15.0%), and for the later rather than the earlier period (5.0%; 95% CI 2.0%, 8.0% vs. 2.0%; 95% CI -3.0%, 8.0%).

The following conclusions were drawn:1.In the majority of infants under 2 years of age, the body temperature rises when exposed to sustained environmental heat.2.This elevation may exceed 103.0° F. in normal, healthy infants (including mature newborn infants), in the absence of any evidence of acute infection.3.Under 2 years of age there is no apparent correlation between age, sex, or color and the susceptibility to develop thermal fever.4.Usually there is a lag phase of thirty-six or more hours from the onset of the atmospheric heat to the rise in body temperature. Similarly, the fever may not subside until twenty-four or more hours after the external temperatures have returned to normal levels.5.Patients with diarrhea seem to develop fever sooner than normal orotherwise ill infants. It is suggested that additional alimentary salt may be beneficial in restoring the body temperature of infants with diarrhea to normal levels.6.A pre-existing acute or chronic infection, especially of the respiratorytract, predisposes to the development of high fever upon exposure to sustained environmental heat.7.In infants with congenital or acquired cerebral defect, there exists amarked tendency to the development of hyperpyretic states and to heat stroke. The temperature may rise to 109.0° F. and the mortality is high.8.These fevers are exceptionally resistant to antipyretic measures once they become established.

As extreme heat events and within season temperature variability is expected to increase in frequency, it is important to understand how this may impact gestational growth. OBJECTIVES: We investigated associations between various measures of weekly prenatal heat exposure (mean and standard deviation (SD) of temperature and heat index (HI), derived using temperature in degreeC and dew point) and term birthweight or odds of being born small for gestational age (SGA) to identify critical windows of susceptibility. METHODS: We analyzed data from mother-child dyads (n = 4442) in the Boston-based Children's HealthWatch cohort. Birthweights were collected from survey data and electronic health records. Daily temperature and HI values were obtained from 800 m gridded spatial climate datasets aggregated by the PRISM Climate Group. Distributed lag-nonlinear models were used to assess the effect of the four weekly heat metrics on measures of gestational growth (birthweight, SGA, and birthweight z-scores). Analyses were stratified by child sex and maternal homelessness status during pregnancy. RESULTS: HI variability was significantly associated with decreased term birthweight during gestational weeks 10-29 and with SGA for weeks 9-26. Cumulative effects for these time periods were -287.4 g (95% CI: -474.1 g, -100.8 g for birthweight and 4.7 (95% CI: 1.6, 14.1) for SGA. Temperature variability was also significantly associated with decreased birthweight between weeks 15 and 26. The effects for mean heat measures on term birthweight and SGA were not significant for any gestational week. Stratification by sex revealed a significant effect on term birthweight in females between weeks 23-28 and in males between weeks 9-26. Strongest effects of HI variability on term birthweight were found in children of mothers who experienced homelessness during pregnancy. Weekly HI variability was the heat metric most strongly associated with measures of gestational growth. The effects observed were largest in males and those who experienced homelessness during pregnancy. DISCUSSION: Given the impact of heat variability on birthweight and risk of SGA, it is important for future heat warnings to incorporate measure of heat index and temperature variability.","Carlson, Jeffrey M     Zanobetti, Antonella     Ettinger de Cuba, Stephanie     Poblacion, Ana P     Fabian, Patricia M     Carnes, Fei     Rhee, Jongeun     Lane, Kevin J     Sandel, Megan T     Janulewicz, Patricia A     eng     P50 MD010428/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/     T32 ES014562/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Less is known about cold-related risk in this population. Our objective was to quantify the health impact from cold and hot temperatures in Ontario. METHODS: The study population consisted of all residents of Ontario who died between Jan. 1, 1996, and Dec. 31, 2010, from any nonaccidental cause. A case-crossover analysis was applied to assess the relation between daily temperature fluctuation and deaths from nonaccidental and selected causes in cold (December-February) and warm (June-August) seasons, respectively, adjusting for various potential confounders. Risk estimates were obtained for each census division, then pooled across Ontario. We examined potential effect modification for selected comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In warm seasons, each 5degreeC increase in daily mean temperature was associated with a 2.5% increase in nonaccidental deaths (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3% to 3.8%) on the day of exposure (lag 0). In cold seasons, each 5degreeC decrease in daily temperature was associated with a 3.0% (95% CI 1.8% to 4.2%) increase in nonaccidental deaths, which persisted over 7 days (lag 0-6). The cold-related effects (lag 0-6) were stronger for cardiovascular-related deaths (any cardiovascular death: 4.1%, 95% CI 2.3% to 5.9%; ischemic heart disease: 5.8%, 95% CI 3.6% to 8.1%), especially among people less than 65 years of age (8.0%, 95% CI 3.0% to 13.0%). Conversely, heat most strongly increased respiratory-related deaths during admission to hospital (26.0%, 95% CI 0% to 61.4%). Across Ontario, each 5degreeC change in daily temperature was estimated to induce 7 excess deaths per day in cold seasons and 4 excess deaths in warm seasons. INTERPRETATION: Heat contributed to excess deaths in Ontario, although the effect of cold weather appeared to be greater.

Electronic address: hhlang0821@sina.com.","Despite consistent evidence of a higher short-term risk of stroke mortality associated with ambient temperature, there are no findings on the association between extreme temperature and stroke. A total of 16,264 stroke hospital admissions were observed in three hospitals of Nanchang between 2008 and 2015. The case-crossover design was utilized for our study. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios. Extreme high temperature exposure during the 3 days before the stroke was associated with both ischemic (OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36) and hemorrhagic stroke admissions (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.26-1.42) as compared to 3-day control periods (1-3 days last week before the onset of stroke). Extreme low temperature was associated with hemorrhagic stroke admission (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.28-1.58) but not ischemic stroke (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.93-1.13). This study suggests that extreme high temperature might be a risk factor for both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, and that extreme low temperature might be a risk factor of hemorrhagic stroke. Further studies are necessary in order to clarify this relationship and provide evidence for stroke prevention.

Examining the relationship between the extreme temperature events (e.g. heat and cold waves) and cardiovascular mortality has profound public significance. However, this evidence is scarce, particularly those from China. We collected daily data on cardiovascular mortality and meteorological conditions from 31 major Chinese cities during the maximum period of 2007-2013. A two-stage analysis was used to estimate the effects of heat and cold waves, and the potential effect modification of their characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in season) on cardiovascular mortality. Firstly, a generalized quasi-Poisson regression combined with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate city-specific effects. Then, the meta-analysis was performed to pool effect estimates at the national scale. Overall, cardiovascular mortality risk increased by 19.03% (95%CI: 11.92%, 26.59%) during heat waves and 54.72% (95%CI: 21.20%, 97.51%) during cold waves. The effect estimates varied by the wave's characteristics. In heat wave days, the cardiovascular mortality risks increased by 3.28% (95%CI: -0.06%, 6.73%) for every 1 degrees C increase in intensity, 2.84% (95%CI: 0.92%, 4.80%) for every 1-d more in duration and -0.07% (95%CI: -0.38%, 0.24%) for every 1-d late in the staring of heat wave; the corresponding estimates for cold wave were 1.82% (95%CI: -0.04%, 3.72%), 1.52% (95%CI: 0.60%, 2.44%) and -0.26% (95%CI: -0.67%, 0.16%). Increased susceptibility to heat and cold waves was observed among patients with ischemic heart disease, females, the elderly, and those with lower education level. And consistent vulnerable populations were found for the effects of changes in cold and heat wave's characteristics. The findings have important implications for the development of early warning systems and plans in response to heat and cold waves, which may contribute to mitigating health threat to vulnerable populations.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Maxime,10.1088/1748-9326/abaea0,heat wave;cold wave;characteristics;cardiovascular disease;vulnerable populations;China;EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS;AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;MODIFIERS;RISK;VULNERABILITY;METAANALYSIS;DEFINITIONS;DISEASES;MODELS;IMPACT;Hot Temperature;Cold Temperature,,

We aimed to estimate the temporal variations in the association between short-term exposures to air temperature and MI in the area of Augsburg, Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over a 28-years period from 1987 to 2014, a total of 27 310 cases of MI and coronary deaths were recorded. Daily meteorological parameters were measured in the study area. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the risk of MI associated with air temperature. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify subpopulations with changing susceptibility to air temperature. Results showed a non-significant decline in cold-related MI risks. Heat-related MI relative risk significantly increased from 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-1.12] in 1987-2000 to 1.14 (95% CI: 1.00-1.29) in 2001-14. The same trend was also observed for recurrent and non-ST-segment elevation MI events. This increasing population susceptibility to heat was more evident in patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. Future studies using multicentre MI registries at different climatic, demographic, and socioeconomic settings are warranted to confirm our findings. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of rising population susceptibility to heat-related MI risk from 1987 to 2014, suggesting that exposure to heat should be considered as an environmental trigger of MI, especially under a warming climate.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Maxime,10.1093/eurheartj/ehz116,Adult;Aged;Environmental Exposure;Female;Germany;*Hot Temperature;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Myocardial Infarction/ep [Epidemiology];Time Factors;Myocardial Infarction,,

The overall risk ratio (95% confidence intervals) of stroke mortality due to the heat wave in Nanjing was 1.34 (1.21 to 1.47). Geolocation was found to be significantly associated with the heat-wave-related stroke mortality risk. Using alternative reference periods generated similar results. A district-level risk assessment revealed similar spatial patterns. The highest stroke mortality risk observed in Luhe district was due to the combination of high heat exposure and high vulnerability.

However, the effect of long-term temperature exposure is unclear, especially in warmer regions. This research aimed to evaluate the association between long-term exposure to temperature and the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD). A retrospective population-based study was conducted using Taiwan nationwide Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. Subjects without MDD diagnosis were followed from 2003 to 2013 for MDD occurrence. Weather factors including temperature (degreeC), sunshine duration (hrs/day), and precipitation (mm/day) were 11-year average of daily data collected from weather monitoring stations of Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to examine the association between MDD incidence and weather factors. Covariates including age, gender, and insurance amount were adjusted. A total of 9,539,752 person-years were followed. People residing in regions with long-term temperature of 20-23degreeC had the lowest risk of developing MDD. Risk for MDD incidence was higher among residents in regions with average temperature>23degreeC, at 7% increase per 1degreeC increment (95% CI=2-12%). The elderly was more vulnerable to such impact of heat exposure. For the elderly, males were more susceptible to heat-related MDD than females (HR=1.18 vs. 1.14). However, the younger group showed a reverse finding (i.e. females 1.07>males 1.04). Long-term residence in regions with extreme cold or heat may increase the risk of MDD incidence, especially higher temperature. Under global warming, these findings have great health implications and warrant further confirmation.","Chen, Nai-Tzu     Lin, Po-Hsiu     Guo, Yue-Liang Leon     eng     Netherlands     2019/05/18     Sci Total Environ. 2019 Apr 1;659:1016-1020. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.434.

In order to study the economic burden of high temperature on the health of Wuhan residents between 2013 and 2019, we employed meta-analysis and the value of statistical life (VSL) approach to calculate the relative risk of high temperature health endpoints, the number of premature deaths, and the corresponding economic losses in Wuhan City, China. The results suggested that the pooled estimates of relative risk of death from high temperature health endpoints was 1.26 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 1.39]. The average number of premature deaths caused by high temperature was estimated to be 77,369 (95% CI: 48,906-105,198) during 2013-2019, and the induced economic losses were 156.1 billion RMB (95% CI: 92.28-211.40 billion RMB), accounting for 1.81% (95% CI: 1.14-2.45%) of Wuhan's annual GDP in the seven-year period. It can be seen that high temperature drives an increase in the premature deaths, and the influence of high temperature on human health results in an economic burden on the health system and population in Wuhan City.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to quantify heatwave effects on four major health outcomes: cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for relevant studies from database inception to November 2018. Categories of morbidity included hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and ambulance attendances/call-outs. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool previous estimates of heatwave effects on mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, and disease cause were conducted. Sensitivity analyses were performed by the categories of morbidity, heatwave definitions, study design, and using a leave-one-out cross validation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number: CRD42018101964). RESULTS: We identified 54 studies conducted in 20 countries. In total, there were significant associations between heatwaves and cardiovascular mortality (risk estimates (RE): 1.149, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.090, 1.210) and respiratory mortality (RE: 1.183, 95%CI: 1.092, 1.282), but the magnitude of these associations varied across countries and studies. Heatwaves appeared to be marginally associated with cardiovascular and respiratory morbidities (RE: 0.999, 95%CI: 0.996, 1.002, p-value=0.61 for cardiovascular morbidity; RE: 1.043, 95%CI: 0.995, 1.093; p-value=0.08 for respiratory morbidity). For mortality, significant associations were observed for the elderly, ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sensitivity analyses suggested that these findings were robust. CONCLUSION: Mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases appeared to be more vulnerable to heatwaves in comparison to morbidity.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Clinical studies on associations between high environmental temperatures, and preterm birth, birth weight, and stillbirths. RESULTS 14 880 records and 175 full text articles were screened. 70 studies were included, set in 27 countries, seven of which were countries with low or middle income. In 40 of 47 studies, preterm births were more common at higher than lower temperatures. Exposures were classified as heatwaves, 1 degrees C increments, and temperature threshold cutoff points. In random effects metaanalysis, odds of a preterm birth rose 1.05-fold (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.07) per 1 degrees C increase in temperature and 1.16-fold (1.10 to 1.23) during heatwaves. Higher temperature was associated with reduced birth weight in 18 of 28 studies, with considerable statistical heterogeneity. Eight studies on stillbirths all showed associations between temperature and stillbirth, with stillbirths increasing 1.05-fold (1.01 to 1.08) per 1 degrees C rise in temperature. Associations between temperature and outcomes were largest among women in lower socioeconomic groups and at age extremes. The multiple temperature metrics and lag analyses limited comparison between studies and settings.

Objectives: This study presents a spatiotemporal analysis of heat and heat wave effects on elderly mortality (>= 65 years) in Texas. Methods: We compiled a six-year daily weather and mortality counts dataset from 254 counties in Texas during 2006-2011. Heat index (HI), a combination of temperature and relative humidity, was used as the exposure metric in this study. Associations between daily all-cause elderly mortality and daily maximum HI and heat waves (>= 2 days of county-specific daily maximum HI >95th percentiles) were examined using a quasi-Poisson regression. A Markov random field smoother was included in the model to account for spatial autocorrelations and spatial heterogeneity. The model also controlled for long-term trend and seasonality in mortality, and the effects of day of the week. Discussion: On average, the lag effect of heat on elderly mortality risk lasted up to 10 days, and the cumulative heat effects started to increase rapidly when daily maximum HI exceeded the 90th percentile in Texas. Elderly living in Northwest Texas and parts of West Texas were at greater risk of elderly mortality attributable to heat waves, and the highest relative risk for elderlymortality occurred in El Paso County (4.70, 95% Confidence Interval = 4.33, 5.10).

As inequality in the United States increases, understanding urban-rural and regional differences in the temperature-mortality association is crucial. OBJECTIVE: We examined regional and urban-rural differences of the temperature-mortality association in North Carolina (NC), USA, and investigated potential effect modifiers. METHODS: We applied time-series models allowing nonlinear temperature-mortality associations for 17 years (2000-2016) to generate heat and cold county-specific estimates. We used second-stage analysis to quantify the overall effects. We also explored potential effect modifiers (e.g. social associations, greenness) using stratified analysis. The analysis considered relative effects (comparing risks at 99th to 90th temperature percentiles based on county-specific temperature distributions for heat, and 1st to 10th percentiles for cold) and absolute effects (comparing risks at specific temperatures). RESULTS: We found null effects for heat-related mortality (relative effect: 1.001 (95% CI: 0.995-1.007)). Overall cold-mortality risk for relative effects was 1.019 (1.015-1.023). All three regions had statistically significant cold-related mortality risks for relative and absolute effects (relative effect: 1.019 (1.010-1.027) for Coastal Plains, 1.021 (1.015-1.027) for Piedmont, 1.014 (1.006-1.023) for Mountains). The heat mortality risk was not statistically significant, whereas the cold mortality risk was statistically significant, showing higher cold-mortality risks in urban areas than rural areas (relative effect for heat: 1.006 (0.997-1.016) for urban, 1.002 (0.988-1.017) for rural areas; relative effect for cold: 1.023 (1.017-1.030) for urban, 1.012 (1.001-1.023) for rural areas). Findings are suggestive of higher relative cold risks in counties with the less social association, higher population density, less green-space, higher PM<sub>2.5,</sub> lower education level, higher residential segregation, higher income inequality, and higher income (e.g., Ratio of Relative Risks 1.72 (0.68, 4.35) comparing low to high education).

We evaluated associations between short-term ambient temperature exposure and hospital admission for kidney disease in Vietnam. METHODS: We linked province-level meteorologic data with admission data from 14 province-level hospitals (2003-2015). We used a case-crossover design to evaluate associations between daily ambient temperature metrics (mean, maximum, and minimum temperature and mean heat index) and risk of hospitalization for four kidney disease subtypes: glomerular diseases, renal tubulo-interstitial diseases, chronic kidney disease, and urolithiasis, including lagged (<=lag 14 days) and cumulative (<=lag 0-6 days) associations, during the warm season. We also evaluated independent associations with extreme heat days (defined as days with daily maximum temperature >95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the provincial daily maximum temperature distribution). Akaike's information criterion and patterns of risk estimates across cumulative exposure time windows and single-day lags informed our selection of final models. RESULTS: We included 58,330 hospital admissions during the warm season. Daily mean temperature averaged over the same day and the previous six days (lag 0-6 days) was associated with risk of hospitalization for each kidney disease outcome with odds ratios (per 1 degreeC increase in daily mean temperature) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99, 1.16) for glomerular diseases, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.17) for renal tubulo-interstitial diseases, 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.24) for chronic kidney disease, and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.16) for urolithiasis. We found no additional independent associations with extreme heat. Results for the four temperature metrics were similar. CONCLUSIONS: High ambient temperature was associated with increased risk of hospitalization for each kidney disease subtype, with the most convincing associations for chronic kidney disease and urolithiasis. Further laboratory and epidemiologic research is needed to confirm the findings and disentangle the underlying mechanisms.","Chu, Lingzhi     Phung, Dung     Crowley, Susan     Dubrow, Robert     eng     Netherlands     2022/01/26     Environ Res. 2022 Jun;209:112776. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.112776.

However, a major limitation of these projection studies is the use of risk estimates derived from nonmortality data to project excess enteric infection mortality associated with temperature because of the lack of studies that used actual deaths. OBJECTIVE: We quantified the associations of daily temperature with both mortality and hospital admissions due to enteric infections in the Philippines. These associations were applied to projections under various climate and population change scenarios. METHODS: We modeled nonlinear temperature associations of mortality and hospital admissions due to enteric infections in 17 administrative regions of the Philippines using a two-stage time-series approach. First, we quantified nonlinear temperature associations of enteric infections by fitting generalized linear models with distributed lag nonlinear models. Second, we combined regional estimates using a meta-regression model. We projected the excess future enteric infections due to nonoptirnal temperatures using regional temperature-enteric infection associations under various combinations of climate change scenarios according to representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and population change scenarios according to shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) for 2010-2099. RESULTS: Regional estimates for mortality and hospital admissions were significantly heterogeneous and had varying shapes in association with temperature. Generally, mortality risks were greater in high temperatures, whereas hospital admission risks were greater in low temperatures. Temperature-attributable excess deaths in 2090-2099 were projected to increase over 2010-2019 by as little as 1.3% [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCI): -3.1%, 6.5%] under a low greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 2.6) or as much as 25.5% (95% eCI: -3.5%, 48.2%) under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5). A moderate increase was projected for temperature-attributable excess hospital admissions, from 0.02% (95% eCI: -2.0%, 1.9%) under RCP 2.6 to 5.2% (95% eCI: -12.7%, 21.8%) under RCP 8.5 in the same period. High temperature-attributable deaths and hospital admissions due to enteric infections may occur under scenarios with high population growth in 2090-2099. DISCUSSION: In the Philippines, futures with hotter temperatures and high population growth may lead to a greater increase in temperature-related excess deaths than hospital admissions due to enteric infections.

We describe the ambient temperature-mortality association for 13 cities in East Asia, Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju, Busan (Korea), Hokkaido, Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka (Japan), Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung (Taiwan), and identify a threshold temperature for each city and the percent increase in mortality. We looked at the effect by sex, age, and summer effect to support the more precise regional effect. Methods: We adapted generalized linear modeling with natural cubic splines (GLM+NS) to examine the association between daily mean apparent temperature and total mortality, as well as mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular causes in a threshold model. We also conducted a time-series analysis adjusting for day of the week, daily humidity, and long-term time trend. Results: Our results confirm that elderly people are most at risk from temperature-mortality and, women seem to be at increased risk compared to men in Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and Japan. Generally, estimates were somewhat higher for cardiovascular compared to total mortality. Summer season showed the highest effect. Cities in lower region had higher threshold, in higher region had lower threshold because of acclimatization. Conclusion: This study identified increased mortality due to exposure to elevated ambient temperature. Weather-mortality relationships from one city may not be applicable to another. Acclimatization, susceptibility, and city characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.

This multisite time-series study examined mortality related to extreme temperatures (both cold and hot) in Northeast Asia, focusing on 15 cities of 3 high-income countries. METHODS: This study includes 3 cities in Taiwan for 1994-2007, 6 cities in Korea for 1992-2010, and 6 cities in Japan for 1972-2009. We used 2-stage Bayesian hierarchical Poisson semiparametric regression to model the nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality, providing city-specific and country-wide estimates for cold and heat effects. Various exposure time frames, age groups, and causes of death were considered. RESULTS: Cold effects had longer time lags (5-11 days) than heat effects, which were immediate (1-3 days). Cold effects were larger for cities in Taiwan, whereas heat effects were larger for cities in Korea and Japan. Patterns of increasing effects with age were observed in both cold and heat effects. Both cold and heat effects were larger for cardiorespiratory mortality than for other causes of death. Several city characteristics related to weather or air pollution were associated with both cold and heat effects. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality increased with either cold or hot temperature in urban populations of high-income countries in Northeast Asia, with spatial variations of effects among cities and countries. Findings suggest that climate factors are major contributors to the spatial heterogeneity of effects in this region, although further research is merited to identify other factors as determinants of variability.","Chung, Yeonseung     Lim, Youn-Hee     Honda, Yasushi     Guo, Yue-Liang Leon     Hashizume, Masahiro     Bell, Michelle L     Chen, Bing-Yu     Kim, Ho     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2015/02/03     Epidemiology. 2015 Mar;26(2):255-62. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000229. | RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara",10.1097/EDE.0000000000000229,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Bayes Theorem;*Cause of Death;Child;Child, Preschool;*Cold Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Japan/ep [Epidemiology];Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Poisson Distribution;Regression Analysis;Republic of Korea/ep [Epidemiology];Risk Factors;Taiwan/ep [Epidemiology];Young Adult",,

Yet, the mental health impacts of temperature have been understudied. Research has shown that the environment can create circumstances that exacerbate mental health issues. This may be particularly challenging for some of the fastest growing cities, located in hot, dry climates. Given the theoretical relationship between air temperature and mental health, we seek to measure the association between temperature and schizophrenia hospital admissions in an arid urban climate and quantify the associated public health burden. We collected 86,672 hospitalization records for schizophrenia from 2006 to 2014 in Maricopa County, Arizona, USA. Using a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), we tested for a statistical association between temperature and schizophrenia hospital admissions after controlling for year, season, weekends, and holidays. We calculated the cumulative attributable risk of nighttime temperature on schizophrenia for the entire dataset as well as among demographic subgroups. The relative risk of schizophrenia hospital admissions increased with both high and low temperatures. Statistical models using daily minimum temperature were more strongly associated with hospitalization than those using mean or maximum. Schizophrenia hospital admissions increased on days with minimum temperatures above 30 °C and below 3 °C, with some subgroups experiencing higher rates of hospitalization. The total fraction of schizophrenia hospital admissions attributable to non-optimal minimum temperature is 3.45 % (CI: −4.91-10.80 %) and high minimum temperature is 0.28 % (CI: −1.18-1.78 %). We found that non-whites and males appear to be at a slightly increased risk than the general population, although there did not appear to be a statistically significant difference. A conservative estimate of healthcare costs annually from non-optimal temperature attributed schizophrenia hospitalization is $1.95 million USD. Therefore, nighttime cooling strategies and efforts could increase the accessibility of shelters to reduce overnight exposure to extreme air temperature.","Crank, Peter J     Hondula, David M     Sailor, David J     eng     Netherlands     2022/12/14     Sci Total Environ. 2023 Mar 1;862:160599. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160599.

We aimed to quantify the impact of ambient temperature on mortality, and to compare the contributions of heat and cold in a large basin climate city, i.e., Chengdu (Sichuan Province, China); Methods: We estimated the temperature-mortality association with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) with a maximum lag-time of 21 days while controlling for long time trends and day of week. We calculated the mortality risk attributable to heat and cold, which were defined as temperatures above and below an ""optimum temperature"" that corresponded to the point of minimum mortality. In addition, we explored effects of individual characteristics; Results: The analysis provides estimates of the overall mortality burden attributable to temperature, and then computes the components attributable to heat and cold. Overall, the total fraction of deaths caused by both heat and cold was 10.93% (95%CI: 7.99%-13.65%). Taken separately, cold was responsible for most of the burden (estimate 9.96%, 95%CI: 6.90%-12.81%), while the fraction attributable to heat was relatively small (estimate 0.97%, 95%CI: 0.46%-2.35%). The attributable risk (AR) of respiratory diseases was higher (19.69%, 95%CI: 14.45%-24.24%) than that of cardiovascular diseases (11.40%, 95%CI: 6.29%-16.01%); Conclusions: In Chengdu, temperature was responsible for a substantial fraction of deaths, with cold responsible for a higher proportion of deaths than heat. Respiratory diseases exert a larger effect on death than other diseases especially on cold days.

However, little is known about the effect of extreme heat on the severity of dengue infection, such as hospital admission. We aimed to quantify the effect of ambient temperature on dengue hospitalisation risk in Brazil. Methods: We retrieved daily dengue hospitalisation counts by each of 5,570 municipalities across the 27 states of Brazil from 1st of January 2010 to 31st of December 2019, from the Brazilian Public Hospital Admission System (“SIH”). We obtained average daily ambient temperature for each municipality from the ERA5-land product reanalysis. We combined distributed lag non-linear models with time stratified design model framework to pool an estimate for dose-response and lag-response structures for the association of Dengue hospitalisation relative risk (RR) and temperature. We estimated the overall dengue hospitalisation RR for the whole country as well as for each of the five macro-regions by meta-analysing state level estimates. Findings: 579,703 hospital admissions due to dengue occurred over the 10 years period of 2010 to 2019. We observed a positive association between high temperatures and high risk of hospitalisation for Brazil and each of the five macro-regions. The overall RR for dengue hospitalisation was at the 50th percentile of temperature distribution 1·40 (95% IC 1·27-1·54) and at 95th percentile of temperature the RR was 1·50 (1·38-1·66) for Brazil, relative to the minimum temperature, which was the one with the lowest risk. We also found lagged effects of heat on hospitalisation, particularly observed on the same day (lag 0) both at the 50th percentile and 95th.

DESIGN: We collected daily mortality data from the Vietnamese A6 mortality reporting system for 6,214 deceased persons between 2009 and 2013. A distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the temperature effects on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by assuming negative binomial distribution for count data. We developed an objective-oriented model selection with four steps following the Akaike information criterion (AIC) rule (i.e. a smaller AIC value indicates a better model). RESULTS: High temperature-related mortality was more strongly associated with short lags, whereas low temperature-related mortality was more strongly associated with long lags. The low temperatures increased risk in all-category mortality compared to high temperatures.

Increasing heat exposures due to climate change are therefore a concern for pregnant women. However, the large heterogeneity of study designs and statistical methods across previous studies complicate interpretation and comparisons. We investigated associations of short-term exposure to high ambient temperature with preterm birth in Sweden, applying three complementary analytical approaches. METHODS: We included 560,615 singleton live births between 2014 and 2019, identified in the Swedish Pregnancy Register. We estimated weekly mean temperatures at 1-km<sup>2</sup> spatial resolution using a spatiotemporal machine learning methodology, and assigned them at the residential addresses of the study participants. The main outcomes of the study were gestational age in weeks and subcategories of preterm birth (<37 weeks): extremely preterm birth (<28 weeks), very preterm birth (from week 28 to <32), and moderately preterm birth (from week 32 to<37). Case-crossover, quantile regression and time-to-event analyses were applied to estimate the effects of short-term exposure to increased ambient temperature during the week before birth on preterm births. Furthermore, distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were applied to identify susceptibility windows of exposures throughout pregnancy in relation to preterm birth. RESULTS: A total of 1924 births were extremely preterm (0.4%), 2636 very preterm (0.5%), and 23,664 moderately preterm (4.2%). Consistent across all three analytical approaches (case-crossover, quantile regression and time-to-event analyses), higher ambient temperature (95th vs 50th percentile) demonstrated increased risk of extremely preterm birth, but associations did not reach statistical significance. In DLNM models, we observed no evidence to suggest an increased effect of high temperature on preterm birth risk. Even so, a suggested trend was observed in both the quantile regression and time-to-event analyses of a higher risk of extremely preterm birth with higher temperature during the last week before birth. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, with high quality data on exposure and outcome, a temperate climate and good quality ante-natal health care, we did not find an association between high ambient temperatures and preterm births. Results were consistent across three complementary analytical approaches.","de Bont, Jeroen     Stafoggia, Massimo     Nakstad, Britt     Hajat, Shakoor     Kovats, Sari     Part, Cherie     Chersich, Matthew     Luchters, Stanley     Filippi, Veronique     Stephansson, Olof     Ljungman, Petter     Roos, Nathalie     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2022/06/08     Environ Res. 2022 Oct;213:113586. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.113586.

However, beyond heat waves and extreme temperatures, there is a seasonal variation in glomerular filtration rate that may contribute to the onset of renal failure and electrolyte disorders during extremely hot periods. Although there are few references in the literature, serum sodium disorders seem to increase. The most vulnerable population to heat-related disease are the elderly, children, chronic patients, bedridden people, disabled people, people living alone or with little social contact, and socioeconomically disadvantaged people.","de Lorenzo, Alberto     Liano, Fernando     eng     spa     Review     Spain     2017/09/28     Nefrologia. 2017 Sep-Oct;37(5):492-500. doi: 10.1016/j.nefro.2016.12.008. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",10.1016/j.nefro.2016.12.008,"Acute Kidney Injury/et [Etiology];Acute Kidney Injury/pp [Physiopathology];Body Temperature Regulation/ph [Physiology];*Climate Change;Dehydration/et [Etiology];Dehydration/pp [Physiopathology];Disease Susceptibility;Glomerular Filtration Rate;Health Services Needs and Demand;Heat Exhaustion/et [Etiology];Heat Exhaustion/pp [Physiopathology];Hemodynamics;*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Kidney/ph [Physiology];Kidney Diseases/ep [Epidemiology];*Kidney Diseases/et [Etiology];Models, Biological;Risk Factors;Seasons;Sweating/ph [Physiology];Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/et [Etiology];Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/pp [Physiopathology];Nephrology;Temperature",,

DESIGN: This observational study applied time series analysis on daily mortality counts according to mean daily temperature (degreeC). SETTING: Statistics Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Death registrations in 2006, 2018 and 2019 from residents registered at the Dutch Personal Records Database, restricted to deaths in the period between April and October. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assuming a V-like relation between temperature and mortality, a segmented linear model was used to estimate the temperature effects on mortality. In order to estimate the effects of severe heat, a second model including a heat threshold of 22degreeC was included in the model. We stratified by sociodemographic groups, calendar year and the five main causes of death (cardiovascular, respiratory, neoplasm, psychological and nervous system, and other) and controlled for time trend and seasonality. RESULTS: The effect of 1degreeC increase in temperature whereby the mean daily temperature exceeded 16degreeC was a 1.57% (95% CI 1.51% to 1.63%) increase in mortality among the total population. In temperature segments whereby the mean daily temperature exceeded 22degreeC, this effect was 2.84% (95% CI 2.73% to 2.93%). Low-income groups were at higher risk of heat-related mortality, compared with high-income groups. Areas with a high PD show relatively weak effects within both the warm and heat segments. CONCLUSION: Results of this study highlight the variation in terms of heat vulnerability among the Dutch population, whereby poor living conditions specifically may increase the effect on high temperature on mortality.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058185,Humans;*Hot Temperature;Time Factors;Netherlands/ep [Epidemiology];Temperature;*Cardiovascular Diseases;Socioeconomic Factors;Hot Temperature,,

We calculated attributable fractions and deaths with 95% empirical CIs (eCIs), that were due to cold and heat, defined as temperatures below and above the median temperature, and for mild and extreme temperatures, defined by cut-offs at the 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles. Results: We analysed 89 467 non-accidental deaths; 4131 were attributable to overall temperatures, with an attributable fraction of 4.75% (95% eCI 2.33% to 6.79%).

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of ambient heat on all-cause mortality on the urban population of Surat, a coastal city in India. Retrospective analysis of all cause mortality data with temperature and humidity was performed for the summer months (March-May) for the period 2001-12. Student's t-test and correlation coefficient were used to study the relationship between ambient heat and mortality. A total of 36,167 deaths for 961 summer days (2001-12) were analysed. Mean daily mortality was estimated at 37.6 +/- 9.4 for the study period. There is an increase of 11% mortality when the temperature crosses 40 degrees C. However, there is an increase of 3 (9%) deaths per day during danger-level heat-risk days and 6 (18%) deaths per day during high-risk heat days (extreme danger) respectively. Mortality seems to be well correlated with the high temperature (P < 0.001) and high heat index (HI) values (P < 0.001). The effect of extreme heat on mortality is at a peak on day-2 of the maximum temperature. The study concludes that the impact of ambient heat in the increase of all cause mortality is clearly evident and HI is more important than maximum temperature (18% deaths/day versus 11% deaths/day). Therefore, emphasis should be given to develop measures of adaptation towards ambient heat.

While a number of studies have investigated the association of temperatures with the risk of cardiovascular diseases, few examined out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and none have done so in Australia. This study examined the exposure-response relationship between temperatures, including heatwaves and OHCA in Brisbane, Australia. METHODS: A quasi-Poisson regression model coupled with a distributed lag non-linear model was employed, using OHCA and meteorological data between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2019. Reference temperature was chosen to be the temperature of minimum risk (21.4degreeC). Heatwaves were defined as daily average temperatures at or above a heat threshold (90th, 95th, 98th, 99th percentile of the yearly temperature distribution) for at least two consecutive days. RESULTS: The effect of any temperature above the reference temperature was not statistically significant; whereas low temperatures (below reference temperature) increased OHCA risk. The effect of low temperatures was delayed for 1 day, sustained up to 3 days, peaking at 2 days following exposures. Heatwaves significantly increased OHCA risk across the operational definitions. When a threshold of 95th percentile of yearly temperature distribution was used to define heatwaves, OHCA risk increased 1.25 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.50) times. When the heat threshold for defining heatwaves increased to 99th percentile, the relative risk increased to 1.48 (1.11 to 1.96). CONCLUSIONS: Low temperatures and defined heatwaves increase OHCA risk. The findings of this study have important public health implications for mitigating strategies aimed at minimising temperature-related OHCA.","Doan, Tan N     Wilson, Daniel     Rashford, Stephen     Bosley, Emma     eng     England     2021/01/14     Occup Environ Med. 2021 Jan 12:oemed-2020-107018. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2020-107018. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",10.1136/oemed-2020-107018,Australia;Heart Arrest,,

This study linked the OneFlorida network (similar to 15 million patients) with an external exposome database to analyze environmental triggers for asthma, bronchitis, and COPD exacerbations while accounting for seasonality, sex, and race/ethnicity. Methods: This is a case-crossover study of OneFlorida database from 2012 to 2017 examining associations of asthma, bronchitis, and COPD exacerbations with exposures to heat index, PM2.5 and O-3. We spatiotemporally linked exposures using patients' residential addresses to generate average exposures during hazard and control periods, with each case serving as its own control. We considered age, sex, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood deprivation index as potential effect modifiers in conditional logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1,148,506 exacerbations among 533,446 patients were included. Across all three conditions, hotter heat indices conferred increasing exacerbation odds, except during November to March, where the opposite was seen. There were significant differences when stratified by race/ethnicity (e.g., for asthma in April, May, and October, heat index quartile 4, odds were 1.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-1.57) for Non-Hispanic Blacks and 2.04 (95% CI 1.92-2.17) for Hispanics compared to 1.27 (95% CI 1.19-1.36) for Non-Hispanic Whites). Pediatric patients' odds of asthma and bronchitis exacerbations were significantly lower than adults in certain circumstances (e.g., for asthma during June - September, pediatric odds 0.71 (95% CI 0.68-0.74) and adult odds 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85) for the highest quartile of PM2.5). Conclusion: This study of acute exacerbations of asthma, bronchitis, and COPD found exacerbation risk after exposure to heat index, PM2.5 and O-3 varies by weather period, age, and race/ethnicity. Future work can build upon these results to alert vulnerable populations to exacerbation triggers. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyze the association between exposure to extreme heat events and risk of hospitalization for AMI in the summer months (June-August) with 0, 1, or 2 lag days. There were a total of 32,670 AMI hospitalizations during the summer months in Maryland between 2000 and 2012. Overall, extreme heat events on the day of hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of AMI (lag 0 OR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.05-1.17). Results considering lag periods immediately before hospitalization were comparable, but effect estimates varied among several population subgroups.

However, estimates on more specific mortality outcomes are sparse, and frequently assessed in studies using different analytical methods. METHODS: A time series analysis was performed on 10 regions in England and Wales during the summers (June-September) of 1993-2006. Average percentage linear increases in risk for a 1degreeC increase in temperature above region-specific thresholds and attributable deaths were computed by cause-specific mortality and age groups (0-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+). RESULTS: There was evidence of increased mortality with heat for almost all cause-of-death groups examined, with an overall increase in all-cause mortality of 2.1% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.6%) for a 1degreeC rise above the regional heat threshold. Among main causes, the steepest increase in risk was for respiratory mortality (+4.1% (3.5% to 4.8%) per 1degreeC). It was much smaller for cardiovascular causes (+1.8% (1.2% to 2.5%)) and myocardial infarction (+1.1% (0.7% to 1.5%)), but comparatively high for arrhythmias (+5.0% (3.2% to 6.9%)) and pulmonary heart disease (+8.3% (2.7% to 14.3%)). Among non- cardiorespiratory causes, the strongest effects were for genitourinary (+3.8% (2.9% to 4.7%)) and nervous system (+4.6% (3.7% to 5.4%)) disorders. 33.9% of heat deaths were attributable to cardiovascular causes, 24.7% to respiratory causes and 41.3% to all other causes combined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the risk of heat-related mortality is distributed across a wide range of different causes, and that targeting of preventative actions based on pre-existing disease is unlikely to be efficient.","Gasparrini, Antonio     Armstrong, Ben     Kovats, Sari     Wilkinson, Paul     eng     G0701030/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     G0701030(82641)/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     G1002296/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     G0501810/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     2011/03/11     Occup Environ Med. 2012 Jan;69(1):56-61. doi: 10.1136/oem.2010.059782.

However, the heterogeneous distribution of drivers of vulnerability can result in local differences in health risks associated with heat and cold. We aimed to analyse the association between ambient air temperature and all-cause mortality across England and Wales and characterise small scale patterns in temperature-related mortality risks and impacts. Methods We performed a country-wide small-area analysis using data on all-cause mortality and air temperature for 34 753 lower super output areas (LSOAs) within 348 local authority districts (LADs) across England and Wales between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2019. We first performed a case time series analysis of LSOA-specific and agespecific mortality series matched with 1 x 1 km gridded temperature data using distributed lag non-linear models, and then a repeated-measure multivariate meta-regression to pool LAD-specific estimates using area-level climatological, socioeconomic, and topographical predictors. Findings The final analysis included 10 716 879 deaths from all causes. The small-area assessment estimated that each year in England and Wales, there was on average 791 excess deaths (empirical 95% CI 611-957) attributable to heat and 60 573 (55 796-65145) attributable to cold, corresponding to standardised excess mortality rates of 1.57 deaths (empirical 95% CI 1. 21-1. 90) per 100 000 person-years for heat and 122.34 deaths (112. 90-131. 52) per 100 000 personyears for cold. The risks increased with age and were highly heterogeneous geographically, with the minimum mortality temperature ranging from 14.9 degrees C to 22.6 degrees C. Heat-related mortality was higher in urban areas, whereas cold-related mortality showed a more nuanced geographical pattern and increased risk in areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation. Interpretation This study provides a comprehensive assessment of excess mortality related to non-optimal outdoor temperature, with several risk indicators reported by age and multiple geographical levels. The analysis provides detailed risk maps that are useful for designing effective public health and climate policies at both local and national levels. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

However, influence of biological sex and/or body mass index (BMI) on the risk of EHS remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the influence of sex and BMI on risk of EHS in the active-duty US Army. We analyzed data from 2016 to 2021, using a matched case-control approach, where each individual with a diagnosis of EHS was matched to five controls based on calendar time, unit ID, and job category, to capture control individuals who were matched to EHS events by location, time, and activity. We used a multivariate logistic regression model mutually adjusted for sex, BMI, and age to compare 745 (n = 61 F) individuals (26 +/- 7 yr) with a diagnosed EHS to 4,290 (n = 384 F) case controls (25 +/- 5 yr). Group average BMI were similar: 26.6 +/- 3.1 (EHS) and 26.5 +/- 3.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (CON). BMI was significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with higher risk of EHS with a 3% increase in risk of EHS for every unit increase in BMI. Notably, sex was not associated with any difference in risk for EHS (P = 0.54). These data suggest that young healthy people with higher BMI have significantly higher risk of EHS, but, contrary to what some have proposed, this risk was not higher in young women.","Giersch, Gabrielle E W     Taylor, Kathryn M     Caldwell, Aaron R     Charkoudian, Nisha     eng     2022/11/08     Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 2023 Jan 1;324(1):R15-R19. doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00168.2022.

The individual factors whereby elevated core temperature produces HI are not well-understood. Given known physiological differences between men and women pertaining to temperature regulation, we hypothesized that women would be at increased risk of HI than men. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the relative risk of HI in women compared with men through an exhaustive literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We search PubMed and Ovid Medline databases from inception to Apr 2017. Search terms included all permutations of sex and heat illness (including heatstroke and exertional heat illness) with no language restrictions. We included adult or adolescent human data reporting comparable male and female HI rates. One reviewer identified and screened titles and abstracts. Two independent reviewers applied eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer. RESULTS: Of 5888 articles identified by searches, 36 were included in the systematic review and 22 in the meta-analysis. The mean (standard deviation) quality score was 3.31(1.25)/5. Overall the rate among women was consistently lower than men across the lifespan. The male: female pooled IRR was 2.28 (p<0.001, 95% CI: 1.66-3.16). There was modest heterogeneity (between-studies variance (tau<sup>2</sup>) =0.02). The rates did not differ significantly when corrected for severity or occupation. DISCUSSION: The rate of HI was significantly increased in men compared with women. Risk for HI might be conferred by psychological and behavioral factors rather than physiological ones. Further research is required to delineate which groups are at greatest risk, leading to the development of mitigation strategies against HI. OTHER: No funding was received.

METHODS: Time-series negative binomial regression analysis was used to assess acute associations between daily ambient temperature and counts of emergency admissions for dementia in each Government region of England, adjusting for season and day-of-week. Using the latest climate and dementia projections data, we then estimate future heat-related dementia burdens under a high emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5), where global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise, and a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6), where GHG emissions are sizeably reduced under a strong global mitigation policy. RESULTS: A raised risk associated with high temperatures was observed in all regions. Nationally, a 4.5% (95% Confidence interval (CI) 2.9%-6.1%) increase in risk of dementia admission was observed for every 1 degreeC increase in temperature above 17 degreeC associated with current climate. Under a high emissions scenario, heat-related admissions are projected to increase by almost 300% by 2040 compared to baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: People living with dementia should be considered a high-risk group during hot weather. Our results support arguments for more stringent climate change mitigation policies.","Gong, Jessica     Part, Cherie     Hajat, Shakoor     eng     NIHR200909/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2021/12/11     Environ Int. 2022 Jan 15;159:107027. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2021.107027.

The Maryland Department of Health has partnered with the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland College Park to develop the 2016 Climate and Health Profile report, which estimates the health impacts of climate change in Maryland. Using historical health data and climate model projections, the report found that climate change will have a disproportionate impact on certain populations across the state. For example, extreme heat and extreme precipitation events during summer months increased the risk of hospitalization for asthma in Maryland by 22% and 11% respectively. But the extreme heat related risk for asthma hospitalization was more pronounced among non-Hispanic whites (33%) than non-Hispanic blacks (20%). Based on these findings, the Department and School have begun to engage with community organizations and various stakeholders to develop interventions and adaptations aimed at increasing resilience and mitigating some of the health impacts.

Few studies have examined the physiological responses to heat load in agriculture. We aimed to assess the heat strain experienced by vineyard workers during canopy management in dry field conditions, and to disentangle the effects of the heat produced by the body and the thermal environment. Thirty workers from five Bordeaux vineyards of southern France were monitored during vine-lifting and trellising (June 2012). The mean heart rate, net cardiac cost, relative cardiac cost, and cardiac workload score were assessed during field activity. As the workers were nested within vineyards, multilevel linear regression models were used for correct inference. Skin temperature increased by an average of 1.0degreeC. Cardiac indices showed marked differences between individuals. The workload was evaluated as 'heavy' or 'very heavy' for more than one-third of the workers, of whom one experienced heat exhaustion. Above some individual characteristics, we highlighted a contextual effect (air temperature) for the mean heart rate (P = 0.03), the relative cardiac cost (P = 0.01) and, to a lesser extent, a cardiac workload score (P = 0.07). Canopy management by hand in vineyards causes considerable cardiac and thermoregulatory strain. Appropriate instruments should be developed to simultaneously evaluate work intensity, work quality, and productivity at the vineyard level to raise the awareness of both managers and employees about taking preventive measures.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara,10.1093/annweh/wxaa115,Farms;France;*Heat Stress Disorders;Heat-Shock Response;Hot Temperature;Humans;*Occupational Exposure,,

In many European countries, particularly in France the heat wave was associated with an increase in mortality. This is the first analysis investigating whether the high temperatures during summer 2003 in Switzerland had a measurable impact on mortality. METHODS: Daily data on all-cause mortality for the period January 1990 to December 2003, and meteorological data from 20 different stations for the same period were analysed. Excess mortality for different age groups, gender and geographic regions was calculated. Daily mortality and temperature in 2003 was correlated with lags of temperature up to 7 days. RESULTS: An estimated 7% increase in all cause mortality occurred during June to August 2003. Excess mortality was limited to the region north of the Alps, to inhabitants of cities and suburban areas and was more pronounced among the elderly and the inhabitants of Basel, Geneva and Lausanne. North of the Alps, deviations in daily mortality were significantly correlated with deviations in maximum daily temperatures and night temperatures. The combination of day temperature above 35 degrees C and night temperatures above 20 degrees C predominantly occurred in Basel and Geneva and might in part explain the regional differences in excess mortality. CONCLUSIONS: As the number of elderly people in Switzerland continues to rise and the occurrence of heat waves is predicted to increase as a consequence of global warming, preventive programmes targeting susceptible populations during heat waves are warranted.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara,10.4414/smw.2005.11009,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Air Pollution;Female;*Heat Stroke/mo [Mortality];Heat Stroke/pc [Prevention & Control];Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Switzerland/ep [Epidemiology];*Weather;Hot Temperature;Switzerland",,

We examined effect modification with interactions between EH and personal marital status, age, race, sex and education and ZIP-code percent ""non-green space"" (National Land Cover Dataset), age, race, income, education, living alone, and housing age (U.S. Census). RESULTS: In models including multiple effect modifiers, the odds of cardiovascular mortality during EH (99 th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH were higher among non-married individuals (1.21, 95% CI=1.14-1.28 vs. 0.98, 95% CI=0.90-1.07 among married individuals) and individuals in ZIP codes with high (91%) non-green space (1.17, 95% CI=1.06-1.29 vs. 0.98, 95% CI=0.89-1.07 among individuals in ZIP codes with low (39%) non-green space). Results suggested that housing age may also be an effect modifier.

However, less evidence is available in developing countries, especially in Thailand. In this study, we examined the relationship between temperature and mortality in Chiang Mai city, Thailand, during 1999-2008. METHOD: A time series model was used to examine the effects of temperature on cause-specific mortality (non-external, cardiopulmonary, cardiovascular, and respiratory) and age-specific non-external mortality (<=64, 65-74, 75-84, and > =85 years), while controlling for relative humidity, air pollution, day of the week, season and long-term trend. We used a distributed lag non-linear model to examine the delayed effects of temperature on mortality up to 21 days. RESULTS: We found non-linear effects of temperature on all mortality types and age groups. Both hot and cold temperatures resulted in immediate increase in all mortality types and age groups. Generally, the hot effects on all mortality types and age groups were short-term, while the cold effects lasted longer. The relative risk of non-external mortality associated with cold temperature (19.35degreeC, 1st percentile of temperature) relative to 24.7degreeC (25th percentile of temperature) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 1.44) for lags 0-21. The relative risk of non-external mortality associated with high temperature (31.7degreeC, 99th percentile of temperature) relative to 28degreeC (75th percentile of temperature) was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.24) for lags 0-21. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that exposure to both hot and cold temperatures were related to increased mortality. Both cold and hot effects occurred immediately but cold effects lasted longer than hot effects. This study provides useful data for policy makers to better prepare local responses to manage the impact of hot and cold temperatures on population health.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara,10.1186/1476-069X-11-36,"Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cardiovascular Diseases/ep [Epidemiology];*Cardiovascular Diseases/mo [Mortality];*Climate;Cold Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Nonlinear Dynamics;Poisson Distribution;Respiratory Tract Diseases/ep [Epidemiology];*Respiratory Tract Diseases/mo [Mortality];Seasons;Thailand/ep [Epidemiology];Time Factors;Urban Health;Thailand;Temperature",,

In South Korea, it is reported that mortality rises with temperature above city-specific thresholds during the hot season in six major cities. However, the health impact of high temperature on morbidity has been inconclusive in South Korea. Objectives: We focused on the relationships with high temperature and morbidity in summer (May- September) in Seoul, South Korea, from 2003-2009. Methods: Poisson regression models adapted for daily time-series data were used to estimate associations between daily temperature (0-1 day lag) above cause of morbidity-specific thresholds and daily morbidity-counts. In our study, morbidity data are episode data based on patients, with applying the episode of care in insurance claim data. We examined heat stroke and invasive diarrhea in three age categories: all ages, <65, and ≥65. Results: The summer temperature thresholds for all ages were 25.1°C and 25.8°C for heat stroke and invasive diarrhea. A 1°C increase in temperatures above morbidity-specific thresholds was associated with increase in episode counts for all ages, for those under the age of 65, and for those over age 65 of 26.45%, 26.51%, and 26.15% for heat stroke, 4.07%, 4.47%, and 1.55% for invasive diarrhea.

We aimed to characterise the associations between ambient temperature and general medical practitioner consultations made by a cohort of type-2 diabetic patients. Evidence on the effects of temperature variation in the primary care setting is currently limited. METHODS: Case-crossover analysis of 4,474,943 consultations in England during 2012-2014, linked to localised temperature at place of residence for each patient. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess associations between each temperature-related consultation and control days matched on day-of-week. RESULTS: There was an increased odds of seeking medical consultation associated with high temperatures: Odds ratio (OR) = 1.097 (95% confidence interval = 1.041, 1.156) per 1 degreeC increase above 22 degreeC. Odds during low temperatures below 0 degreeC were also significantly raised: OR = 1.024 (1.019, 1.030). Heat-related consultations were particularly high among diabetics with cardiovascular comorbidities: OR = 1.171 (1.031, 1.331), but there was no heightened risk with renal failure or neuropathy comorbidities. Surprisingly, lower odds of heat-related consultation were associated with the use of diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics or antidepressants compared to non-use, especially among those with cardiovascular comorbidities, although differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Type-2 diabetic patients are at increased odds of medical consultation during days of temperature extremes, especially during hot weather. The common assumption that certain medication use heightens the risk of heat illness was not borne-out by our study on diabetics in a primary care setting and such advice may need to be reconsidered in heat protection plans.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Sara,10.1186/s12940-017-0284-7,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Case-Control Studies;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/th [Therapy];England;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Primary Health Care/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];*Primary Health Care;*Residence Characteristics;Risk Factors;Seasons;*Temperature;Young Adult;P-Glycoprotein;Referral and Consultation;Temperature",,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the subgroups of the population that are most vulnerable to heat-related and cold-related mortality. METHODS: Ecological time-series study of daily mortality in all regions of England and Wales between 1993 and 2003, with postcode linkage of individual deaths to a UK database of all care and nursing homes, and 2001 UK census small-area indicators. RESULTS: A risk of mortality was observed for both heat and cold exposure in all regions, with the strongest heat effects in London and strongest cold effects in the Eastern region. For all regions, a mean relative risk of 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.03) was estimated per degree increase above the heat threshold, defined as the 95th centile of the temperature distribution in each region, and 1.06 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.06) per degree decrease below the cold threshold (set at the 5th centile). Elderly people, particularly those in nursing and care homes, were most vulnerable. The greatest risk of heat mortality was observed for respiratory and external causes, and in women, which remained after control for age. Vulnerability to either heat or cold was not modified by deprivation, except in rural populations where cold effects were slightly stronger in more deprived areas.

METHODS: This matched case-control study used statewide, longitudinally linked emergency department (ED) data and death records from California. Cases comprised California residents (>=18 years) who presented to a state-licensed ED and died of hyperthermia during the study period (2009-2012). For each case, up to five ED patients were randomly selected as live controls and matched on sex and age. Patients' demographic characteristics and history of ED utilization for alcohol use, drug use, psychiatric disorders, heart-related conditions, chronic respiratory disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cerebrovascular disease were assessed in relationship to hyperthermia mortality. RESULTS: Using multivariate conditional logistic regression models, hyperthermia mortality cases had higher odds of prior ED utilization for alcohol use (OR = 11.16, 95% CI = 3.87, 32.17) compared to controls.

OBJECTIVES: We used city-specific data including BD cases and meteorological variables to determine the relationship between BD incidence and temperature at provincial level. METHODS: Weekly BD disease surveillance data and meteorological variables were collected in all 16 prefecture-level cities in Anhui Province of China. Firstly, city-specific weekly mean temperature-BD incidence associations were estimated with Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM). Secondly, city-specific estimates were pooled at province-level through multivariate meta-analysis. Also, we conducted subgroup analyses for ages (children <5years old and population of other ages) and urbanization of cities (high and low level), respectively. RESULTS: In Anhui, BD morbidity risk increased with increasing weekly mean temperature. Relative risks (RR) at the 90th percentile (27.5degreeC) versus the 50th percentile (17degreeC) of weekly mean temperature were 1.42 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 1.75) and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.76, 2.32) for children <5 and population of other ages, respectively. The relative risk of high temperature on other ages group was higher than that of children under five years old (p=0.006). Children under 5 in high urbanized cities appeared to be more vulnerable to the effects of ambient high temperature (RR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.92) than in low urbanized cities (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.46), the difference between two intervals was statistically significant (p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high temperatures may be an important trigger of BD incidence, and especially lead to a substantial burden of BD for high urbanized cities in Anhui Province of China.","Hao, Yanbin     Liao, Wenmin     Ma, Wanwan     Zhang, Jin     Zhang, Na     Zhong, Shuang     Wang, Zhe     Yang, Lianping     Huang, Cunrui     eng     Netherlands     2019/06/13     Sci Total Environ. 2019 Jun 25;671:1206-1213. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.443.

Few studies have examined modification effects of multiple greenness indicators on such contributions, es-pecially in China. We quantified the associations between ambient temperature and overall, ischemic, and hemor-rhagic stroke mortality; further examined whether the associations were modified by greenness.Methods: We conducted a multicenter time-series analysis from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2019. we adopted a distributed lag non-linear model to evaluate county-specific temperature-stroke mortality associations. We then ap-plied a random-effects meta-analysis to pool county-specific effects. Attributable mortality was calculated for cold and heat, defined as temperatures below and above the minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Finally, We con-ducted a multivariate meta-regression to determine associations between greenness and stroke mortality risks for cold and heat, using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and en-hanced vegetation index (EVI) as quantitative indicators of greenness exposure.Results: In the study period, 138,749 deaths from total stroke were reported: 86,873 ischemic and 51,876 hemorrhagic stroke. We observed significant W-shaped relationships between temperature and stroke mortality, with substantial differences among counties and regions. With MMT as the temperature threshold, 17.16 % (95 % empirical CI, 13.38 %-19.75 %) of overall, 20.05 % (95 % eCI, 16.46 %-22.70 %) of ischemic, and 12.55 % (95 % eCI, 5.59 %- 16.24 %) of hemorrhagic stroke mortality were attributable to non-optimum temperature (combining cold and heat), more mortality was caused by cold (14.94 %; 95 % eCI, 11.57 %-17.34 %) than by heat (2.22 %; 95 % eCI, 1.54 %-2.72 %). Higher levels of NDVI, SAVI and EVI were related to mitigated effects of non-optimum tempera-tures-especially heat.Conclusions: Exposure to non-optimum temperatures aggravated stroke mortality risks; increasing greenness could al-leviate that risks.

Placental abruption is a medical emergency associated with major morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. We determined the relationship between ambient temperature and risk of placental abruption in warm seasons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a case-crossover analysis of 17,172 women whose pregnancies were complicated by placental abruption in Quebec, Canada from May to October 1989-2012. The main exposure measure was the maximum temperature reached during the week before abruption. We computed odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of temperature with placental abruption, adjusted for humidity and public holidays. We assessed whether associations were stronger preterm or at term, or varied with maternal age, parity, comorbidity and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Compared with 15degreeC, a maximum weekly temperature of 30degreeC was associated with 1.07 times the odds of abruption (95% CI 0.99-1.16). When the timing of abruption was examined, the associations were significantly stronger at term (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.24) than preterm (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83-1.10). Relationships were more prominent at term for women who were younger than 35years old, nulliparous or socioeconomically disadvantaged, but did not vary with comorbidity. Associations were stronger within 1 and 5days of abruption. Temperature was not associated with preterm abruption regardless of maternal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated temperatures in warm seasons may increase the risk of abruption in women whose pregnancies are near or at term. Pregnant women may be more sensitive to heat and should consider preventive measures such as air conditioning and hydration during hot weather.","He, Siyi     Kosatsky, Tom     Smargiassi, Audrey     Bilodeau-Bertrand, Marianne     Auger, Nathalie     eng     MOP-130452/CIHR/Canada     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2017/11/18     Environ Int. 2018 Feb;111:295-300. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2017.11.004.

This study examines the association between heat and diabetes mortality in different regions of Thailand and investigates whether heat effects are modified by regional greenness. Daily temperature and daily diabetes deaths data were obtained for 60 provinces of Thailand during 2000-2008. A case-crossover analysis was conducted to quantify the odds of heat-related death among diabetes. Meta-regression was then used to examine potential modification effects of regional greenness (as represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) on heat-related mortality. A strong association between heat and diabetes mortality was found in Thailand, with important regional variations. Nationally, the pooled odds ratio of diabetes mortality was 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.14) for heat (90th percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.10-1.30) for extreme heat (99th percentile of temperature) compared with the minimum mortality temperature, across lag 0-1 days. Central and northeast Thailand were the most vulnerable regions. Regional greenness modified the effects of heat, with lower mortality impacts in areas of higher levels of greenness. In conclusion, heat exposure increases mortality risk in diabetes, with large geographical variations in risk suggesting the need for region-specific public health strategies. Increasing greenness levels may help to reduce the burden of heat on diabetes in Thailand against the backdrop of a warming climate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In August 2003 there was a heat wave in the UK which lasted ten days, this was associated with an increase in mortality during that period; 2000 deaths were attributed to the heat. NHS England states that the major risk during a heat wave is dehydration and overheating, especially for those with pre-existing co-morbidity seen in the elderly. Aim The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the incidence of AKI and climatic temp changes. Hypothesis: During periods of very hot weather in the UK the incidence of AKI would increase. Methods: The Study was conducted one of the warmest counties in the UK. Data on the weather were taken from a local weather web site from 01-01-2012 - 31-12-2015. Serum creatinine results were extracted from the regional pathology data base. Patterns of testing were examined and compared to those when the temp was ≥25 °c and during a period defined using the met office definition of a heat wave. Simple correlations between number of tests, numbers of AKI and temp were performed. Finally, data from the local AKI database was matched to temp data. The data was weighted to correct for number of serum creatinine tests per day. Logistic regression analysis examined the independent effect of temp on the odds of having an AKI during hot weather. Results: There were 9 Heat waves during the study period. 157 days were the maximum temp was ≥25°c. The mean number of tests at the weekend was less than the week however the pattern of testing did not change when split when split into groups of < 10°c, 10°c - 25° c and ≥ 25°c or when there was a heat wave (figure 1). There was no significant difference between the means for numbers of tests (1833.2, 1848.6 and 1888.4) and numbers of AKI (62.0, 57.4, 59.2, respectively, figure 2). There was no correlation between maximum temp on the day of the request, the day before and three days before and the incidence of AKI (figure 3). The multivariable analysis did not demonstrate an association with incidence and stage of AKI having corrected for baseline GFR and Charlson co-morbidity score (coefficient 0.001. CI 0.00 - 0.00). Conclusions: This study shows that there is no increased risk of AKI during summer heat-waves in England. A possible explanation for this is that the temps in the UK are insufficiently high for long periods of time for the development of AKI, since countries with hotter climates have suggested a link. However it does show a small significant relationship between increased testing and incident AKI and colder weather. This could be attributed to exacerbation of co-morbid conditions during winter months in vulnerable adults who become too unwell or confused to remain adequately hydrated.

It causes excess mortality due to prolonged exposure to such extreme heat. However, there is lack of universal definition of prolonged heat or heat wave, which leads to inadequacies of associated risk preparedness. Previous studies focused on estimating temperature-mortality relationship based on temperature thresholds for assessing heat-related health risks but only several studies investigated the association between types of prolonged heat and excess mortality. However, most studies focused on one or a few isolated heat waves, which cannot demonstrate typical scenarios that population has experienced. In addition, there are limited studies on the difference between daytime and nighttime temperature, resulting in insufficiency to conclude the effect of prolonged heat. In sub-tropical high-density cities where prolonged heat is common in summer, it is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of prolonged heat for a complete assessment of heat-related health risks. In this study, six types of prolonged heat were examined by using a time-stratified analysis. We found that more consecutive hot nights contribute to higher mortality risk while the number of consecutive hot days does not have significant association with excess mortality. For a day after five consecutive hot nights, there were 7.99% [7.64%, 8.35%], 7.74% [6.93%, 8.55%], and 8.14% [7.38%, 8.88%] increases in all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. Non-consecutive hot days or nights are also found to contribute to short-term mortality risk. For a 7-day-period with at least five non-consecutive hot days and nights, there was 15.61% [14.52%, 16.70%] increase in all-cause mortality at lag 0-1, but only -2.00% [-2.83%, -1.17%] at lag 2-3.

However, while the UHI effect is further intensified during extreme heat events, prior studies have rarely mapped the UHI effect during extreme heat events to assess its direct temperature impact on mortality. This study examined the UHI effect during extreme heat and non-extreme heat scenarios and compared their temperature-mortality associations in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2019. Four urban heat island degree hour (UHIdh) scenarios were mapped onto Hong Kong's tertiary planning units and classified into three levels (Low, Moderate, and High). We assessed the association between temperature and non-external mortality of populations living in each UHIdh level for the extreme heat/non-extreme heat scenarios during the 2010-2019 hot seasons. Our results showed substantial differences between the temperature-mortality associations in the three levels under the UHIdh extreme heat scenario (UHIdh_EH). While there was no evidence of increased mortality in Low UHIdh_EH areas, the mortality risk in Moderate and High UHIdh_EH areas were significantly increased during periods of hot temperature, with the High UHIdh_EH areas displaying almost double the risk (RR: 1.08, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.14 vs. RR: 1.05, 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.09). However, other non-extreme heat UHI scenarios did not demonstrate as prominent of a difference. When stratified by age, the heat effects were found in Moderate and High UHIdh_EH among the elderly aged 75 and above. Our study found a difference in the temperature-mortality associations based on UHI intensity and potential heat vulnerability of populations during extreme heat events. Preventive measures should be taken to mitigate heat especially in urban areas with high UHI intensity during extreme heat events, with particular attention and support for those prone to heat vulnerability, such as the elderly and poorer populations.","Ho, Janice Y     Shi, Yuan     Lau, Kevin K L     Ng, Edward Y Y     Ren, Chao     Goggins, William B     eng     Netherlands     2022/11/04     Sci Total Environ. 2023 Feb 1;858(Pt 1):159791. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159791.

Compromised vascular function might contribute to this vulnerability. The role of temperature and ozone has been little investigated in this context. We examined the association of short-term increases in ambient temperature and ozone with arterial blood pressure and augmentation pressure and index, a measure of arterial stiffness, in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We conducted a panel study in 45 subjects with T2DM in Boston, Massachusetts, from September 2006 until April 2009. Hourly central site measurements of temperature, meteorology, ozone and fine particulate matter were conducted. Pulse wave analysis and blood pressure measurements were performed on up to 5 occasions two weeks apart after an overnight fast. We applied linear mixed models with random participant intercepts to investigate the association of ambient temperature and ozone with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and augmentation pressure and index, controlling for season, day of week, meteorological variables, fine particulate matter, and subject characteristics. Analyses of ozone were restricted to spring, summer and fall. Results: Most subjects were female (61%) and were regularly taking anti-hypertensive medication (77%). Mean blood pressure was 130/74 mmHg. Mean temperature during the 3 days prior to the examination (3-day moving average) was 13.2 °C, mean ozone concentration (5-day moving average) was 27.0 ppb. Temperature showed a consistent and monotonic association with decreases in arterial blood pressure. Per interquartile (IQR) increase in temperature (12 °C), systolic, diastolic and augmentation pressure decreased by 7.5 mmHg (95% CI 3.1 to 11.7 mmHg), 3.1 mmHg (1.1 to 5.0 mmHg) and 2.6 mmHg (0.7 to 4.4 mmHg), respectively. Effects of ozone were similar: Per IQR of the 5-day moving average (10.5 ppb), systolic, diastolic and augmentation pressure decreased by 5.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.7 to 8.9 mmHg), 2.1 mmHg (0.6 to 3.5 mmHg) and 1.8 mmHg (0.4 to 3.2 mmHg), respectively. Augmentation index was not reduced. Including temperature and ozone in the same model reduced the effect estimates only slightly. Conclusions: In subjects with T2DM, higher temperature and ozone reduce arterial blood pressure, independently of short-term fine particulate exposure.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether short-term exposures to air pollution (fine particles, ozone) and heat resulted in perturbation of arterial blood pressure (BP) in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We conducted a panel study in 70 subjects with T2DM, measuring BP by automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer and pulse wave analysis every 2 weeks on up to five occasions (355 repeated measures).

Indicators of temperature extremes included the 95th percentile of apparent temperature (AT) and temperatures above the previous 6-day average of maximum and minimum temperature. Indicators of variability included daily and weekly variation, and temperature variation between the current and prior weeks. Region level analyses were conducted by Poisson generalized additive models, and controlled for ozone, day of week, holidays, after holiday, blackouts and long-term trends. Statewide pooled estimates were calculated using Bayesian hierarchical models while controlling for regional differences in socio-demographics, mean AT and health care access. Results: We observed significant increases (range: 0.49%-1.5%) in CVD morbidity associated with extreme heat using both indicators. Daily temperature variation did not affect CVD. There was a 0.23% increase in CVD per 1°C increase in weekly variation. Increase of maximum or minimum temperature ranges between the current and prior weeks was associated with 0.16% and 0.19% increased risks of CVD. Conclusions: This study suggested that extreme high temperature and weekly temperature variability may be associated with CVD admissions in New York State.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim,10.1097/01.ede.0000417144.01690.ce,ozone;cardiovascular disease;hospitalization;temperature;high temperature;United States;society;epidemiology;climate change;morbidity;leisure;summer;model;heat;health;risk;health care access;mortality;Cardiovascular Diseases;Temperature,,

To better estimate the burden of extreme temperatures we estimated their effects on years of life lost due to CVD. Methods: The data were daily observations on weather and CVD mortality for Brisbane, Australia between 1996 and 2004. We estimated the association between daily mean temperature and years of life lost due to CVD, after adjusting for trend, season, day of the week, and humidity. To examine the nonlinear and delayed effects of temperature, a distributed lag non-linear model was applied. Residuals from the model were examined to investigate whether there were any added effects due to cold spells and heat waves. Results: The exposure-response curve between temperature and years of life lost was U-shaped, with the lowest years of life lost at 24 °C. For a mean temperature of 10 °C, there were 33 years of life lost (95% CI: 12-54 years) per day. There were 45 years of life lost (95% CI: 22-68 years) per day for days with a mean temperature of 32 °C. The curve had a sharper rise at extremes of heat than of cold. There were substantial added effects of heat waves on years of life lost for CVD mortality, whereas there was no significant increase in years of life lost during cold spells. Conclusions: This study shows convincing evidence that people with CVD are indeed at risk of temperature-related deaths. To reduce temperature-related years of life lost, research on specific interventions is needed.","Huang, Cunrui     Barnett, Adrian G     Wang, Xiaoming     Tong, Shilu     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2012/09/20     Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2012 Sep 1;5(5):609-14. doi: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.965707. | RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim",10.1097/01.ede.0000416849.35099.0a,temperature;mortality;time series analysis;Australia;death;heat;society;epidemiology;cardiovascular disease;season;weather;humidity;exposure;model;statistical model;human;risk;Temperature,,

However, there's only a scrap of evidence paying attention to the link between temperature and skin diseases, and no relevant national research was performed in China. Objective: This study aimed to quantify the effect of heat on skin diseases and identify the vulnerable populations and areas in China. Methods: Daily meteorological data, air pollutant data and outpatient data were collected from in 18 sites of China during 2014-2018. A time-series study with distributed lag nonlinear model and multivariate meta-analysis was applied to analyze the site-specific and pooled associations between daily mean temperature and daily outpatient visits of skin diseases by using the data of warm season (from June to September).

So far, only few studies have taken this approach, and, in particular, no such assessments exist for Germany, the most populated country of Europe. Methods: We assess temperature-related mortality in 12 major German cities based on daily time-series of all-cause mortality and daily mean temperatures in the period 1993-2015, using distributed-lag non-linear models in a two-stage design. Resulting risk functions are applied to estimate excess mortality in terms of GMT rise relative to pre-industrial levels, assuming no change in demographics or population vulnerability. Results: In the observational period, cold contributes stronger to temperature-related mortality than heat, with overall attributable fractions of 5.49% (95%CI: 3.82-7.19) and 0.81% (95%CI: 0.72-0.89), respectively. Future projections indicate that this pattern could be reversed under progressing global warming, with heat-related mortality starting to exceed cold-related mortality at 3 degrees C or higher GMT rise. Across cities, projected net increases in total temperature-related mortality were 0.45% (95%CI: -0.02-1.06) at 3 degrees C, 1.53% (95%CI: 0.96-2.06) at 4 degrees C, and 2.88% (95%CI: 1.60-4.10) at 5 degrees C, compared to today's warming level of 1 degrees C. By contrast, no significant difference was found between projected total temperature-related mortality at 2 degrees C versus 1 degrees C of GMT rise. Conclusions: Our results can inform current adaptation policies aimed at buffering the health risks from increased heat exposure under climate change. They also allow for the evaluation of global mitigation efforts in terms of local health benefits in some of Germany's most populated cities.","Huber, Veronika     Krummenauer, Linda     Pena-Ortiz, Cristina     Lange, Stefan     Gasparrini, Antonio     Vicedo-Cabrera, Ana M     Garcia-Herrera, Ricardo     Frieler, Katja     eng     MR/M022625/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     MR/R013349/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2020/04/18     Environ Res. 2020 Jul;186:109447. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2020.109447.

Identifying potentially modifiable triggers toward the end of gestation, such as extreme heat, can improve understanding of the role of acute stress on early deliveries and inform warning systems. In this study we examined the association between extreme heat, variously defined during the last week of gestation, and risk of preterm birth among mothers in California. METHODS: We created a population-based cohort comprised of 1,967,300 mothers who had live, singleton births in California, from May through September 2005-2013. Daily temperature data estimated at the maternal zip code of residence was used to create 12 definitions of extreme heat with varying relative temperatures (75th, 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles) and durations (at least 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days). We estimated risk of preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks) in relation to exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation with multi-level Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for maternal characteristics, sex of neonate, and seasonality. We also included randomly generated data, SAS code, and estimates for reproducibility purposes. RESULTS: Approximately 7% of the cohort had a preterm birth. For all definitions of extreme heat, the risk of preterm birth was consistently higher among mothers who experienced an extreme heat episode during their last week of gestation. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.008 (95% CI: 0.997, 1.021) to 1.128 (95% CI: 1.052, 1.210), with increasing associations as the relative temperature and duration of extreme heat episode increased. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the previous literature by considering multiple definitions of extreme heat and applying a time-to-event framework. Findings suggest that acute exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation may trigger an earlier delivery. Implementing heat warning systems targeted toward pregnant women may improve birth outcomes.","Ilango, Sindana D     Weaver, Meschelle     Sheridan, Paige     Schwarz, Lara     Clemesha, Rachel E S     Bruckner, Tim     Basu, Rupa     Gershunov, Alexander     Benmarhnia, Tarik     eng     P30 AG059299/AG/NIA NIH HHS/     R01 CA228147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2020/02/15     Environ Int. 2020 Apr;137:105541. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2020.105541.

We investigated the effect of high temperatures on daily mortality in three cities in Europe (Budapest, London, and Milan), using a standard approach. METHODS: An ecological time-series study of daily mortality was conducted in three cities using Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion. Secular trends in mortality and seasonal confounding factors were controlled for using cubic smoothing splines of time. Heat exposure was modelled using average values of the temperature measure on the same day as death (lag 0) and the day before (lag 1). The heat effect was quantified assuming a linear increase in risk above a cut-point for each city. Socio-economic status indicators and census data were linked with mortality data for stratified analyses. RESULTS: The risk of heat-related death increased with age, and females had a greater risk than males in age groups > or =65 years in London and Milan. The relative risks of mortality (per degrees C) above the heat cut-point by gender and age were: (i) Male 1.10 (95%CI: 1.07-1.12) and Female 1.07 (1.05-1.10) for 75-84 years, (ii) M 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and F 1.08 (1.06-1.11) for > or = or =85 years in Budapest (> or =24 degrees C); (i) M 1.03 (1.01-1.04) and F 1.07 (1.05-1.09), (ii) M 1.05 (1.03-1.07) and F 1.08 (1.07-1.10) in London (> or =20 degrees C); and (i) M 1.08 (1.03-1.14) and F 1.20 (1.15-1.26), (ii) M 1.18 (1.11-1.26) and F 1.19 (1.15-1.24) in Milan (> or =26 degrees C). Mortality from external causes increases at higher temperatures as well as that from respiratory and cardiovascular disease. There was no clear evidence of effect modification by socio-economic status in either Budapest or London, but there was a seemingly higher risk for affluent non-elderly adults in Milan. CONCLUSION: We found broadly consistent determinants (age, gender, and cause of death) of heat related mortality in three European cities using a standard approach.

In the United States (U.S.) much of what is known about HSI epidemiology is from analyses of urban heat waves. There is limited research addressing whether HSI hospitalization risk varies between urban and rural areas, nor is much known about additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized for HSI. Methods: Hospitalizations in Illinois for HSI (ICD-9-CM codes 992.x or E900) in the months of May through September from 1987 to 2014 (n = 8667) were examined. Age-adjusted mean monthly hospitalization rates were calculated for each county using U.S. Census population data. Counties were categorized into five urban-rural strata using Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) (RUCC1, most urbanized to RUCC5, thinly populated). Average maximum monthly temperature (C-circle) was calculated for each county using daily data. Multi-level linear regression models were used, with county as the fixed effect and temperature as random effect, to model monthly hospitalization rates, adjusting for the percent of county population below the poverty line, percent of population that is Non-Hispanic Black, and percent of the population that is Hispanic. All analyses were stratified by county RUCC. Additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized for HSI and charges for hospitalization were summarized. Results: Highest rates of HSI hospitalizations were seen in the most rural, thinly populated stratum (mean annual summer hospitalization rate of 1.16 hospitalizations per 100,000 population in the thinly populated strata vs. 0.45 per 100,000 in the metropolitan urban strata). A one-degree Celsius increase in maximum monthly average temperature was associated with a 0.34 increase in HSI hospitalization rate per 100,000 population in the thinly populated counties compared with 0. 02 per 100,000 in highly urbanized counties. The most common additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized with HSI were dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute renal disorders. Total and mean hospital charges for HSI cases were $167.7 million and $20,500 (in 2014 US dollars). Conclusion: Elevated temperatures appear to have different impacts on HSI hospitalization rates as function of urbanization. The most rural and the most urbanized counties of Illinois had the largest increases in monthly hospitalization rates for HSI per unit increase in the average monthly maximum temperature. This suggests that vulnerability of communities to heat is complex and strategies to reduce HSI may need to be tailored to the degree of urbanization of a county.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim,10.1186/s12940-017-0245-1,Heat stress illness;Temperature;Climate change;Temperature-heat;stress illness relationship;Urban-rural differences;EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS;HIGH AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;UNITED-STATES;EXTREME-HEAT;KING COUNTY;MORTALITY;WAVE;MORBIDITY;IMPACTS;CLIMATE;Hot Temperature,,

Epidemiological evidence for heat-related PROM risk is extremely limited. We investigated associations between acute heatwave exposure and spontaneous PROM. METHODS: We conducted this retrospective cohort study among mothers in Kaiser Permanente Southern California who experienced membrane ruptures during the warm season (May-September) from 2008 to 2018. Twelve definitions of heatwaves with different cut-off percentiles (75th, 90th, 95th, and 98th) and durations (>= 2, 3, and 4 consecutive days) were developed using the daily maximum heat index, which incorporates both daily maximum temperature and minimum relative humidity in the last gestational week. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted separately for spontaneous PROM, term PROM (TPROM), and preterm PROM (PPROM) with zip codes as the random effect and gestational week as the temporal unit. Effect modification by air pollution (i.e., PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>), climate adaptation measures (i.e., green space and air conditioning [AC] penetration), sociodemographic factors, and smoking behavior was examined. RESULTS: In total, we included 190,767 subjects with 16,490 (8.6%) spontaneous PROMs. We identified a 9-14% increase in PROM risks associated with less intense heatwaves. Similar patterns as PROM were found for TPROM and PPROM. The heat-related PROM risks were greater among mothers exposed to a higher level of PM<sub>2.5</sub> during pregnancy, under 25 years old, with lower education and household income level, and who smoked. Even though climate adaptation factors were not statistically significant effect modifiers, mothers living with lower green space or lower AC penetration were at consistently higher heat-related PROM risks compared to their counterparts. CONCLUSION: Using a rich and high-quality clinical database, we detected harmful heat exposure for spontaneous PROM in preterm and term deliveries. Some subgroups with specific characteristics were more susceptible to heat-related PROM risk.","Jiao, Anqi     Sun, Yi     Sacks, David A     Avila, Chantal     Chiu, Vicki     Molitor, John     Chen, Jiu-Chiuan     Sanders, Kelly T     Abatzoglou, John T     Slezak, Jeff     Benmarhnia, Tarik     Getahun, Darios     Wu, Jun     eng     R01 ES030353/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Netherlands     2023/02/23     Environ Int. 2023 Mar;173:107824. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2023.107824.

Young infants are particularly vulnerable to environmental health risks, which are modified by socioeconomic factors that change over time. We investigated the association between ambient temperature and neonatal mortality in northern Sweden during the demographic transition. METHODS: Parish register data and temperature data in coastal Vasterbotten, Sweden, between 1880 and 1950 were used. Total and sex-specific neonatal mortality was modelled as a function of mean temperature, adjusting for age, seasonality and calendar time, using discrete-time survival analysis. A linear threshold function was applied with a cut point at 14.5 degreeC (the minimum mortality temperature). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Further analyses were stratified by study period (1800-1899, 1900-1929, and 1930-1950). RESULTS: Neonatal mortality was 32.1 deaths/1000 live births, higher in boys than in girls, and decreased between 1880 and 1950, with high inter-annual variability. Mean daily temperature was +2.5 degreeC, ranging from -40.9 degreeC to +28.8 degreeC. At -20 degreeC, the OR of neonatal death was 1.56 (CI 1.30-1.87) compared to the reference at +14.5 degreeC. Among girls, the OR of mortality at -20 degreeC was 1.17 (0.88-1.54), and among boys, it was 1.94 (1.53-2.45). A temperature increase from +14.5 to +20 degreeC was associated with a 25% increase of neonatal mortality (OR 1.25, CI 1.04-1.50). Heat- and cold-related risks were lowest between 1900 and 1929. CONCLUSIONS: In this remote sub-Arctic region undergoing socio-economic changes, we found an increased mortality risk in neonates related to low but also to high temperature. Climate vulnerability varied across time and was particularly high among boys. This demonstrates that environmental impacts on human health are complex and highly dependent on the specific local context, with many, often unknown, contributing determinants of vulnerability.","Junkka, Johan     Karlsson, Lena     Lundevaller, Erling     Schumann, Barbara     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2020/11/02     Environ Res. 2021 Jan;192:110400. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2020.110400.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the link between climatic factors and occurrence of invasive respiratory bacterial disease in a Sahel region of Niger. METHODS: We conducted daily disease surveillance and climatic monitoring over an 8-year period between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2010, in Niamey, Niger, to determine risk factors for bacterial meningitis and invasive bacterial disease. We investigated the mechanistic effects of these factors on Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. RESULTS: High temperatures and low visibility (resulting from high concentrations of airborne dust) were identified as significant risk factors for bacterial meningitis. Dust inhalation or exposure to high temperatures promoted progression of stable asymptomatic pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage to pneumonia and invasive disease. Dust exposure significantly reduced phagocyte-mediated bacterial killing, and exposure to high temperatures increased release of the key pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin through increased bacterial autolysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that climatic factors can have a substantial influence on infectious disease patterns, altering density of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, reducing phagocytic killing, and resulting in increased inflammation and tissue damage and consequent invasiveness. Climatic surveillance should be used to forecast invasive bacterial disease epidemics, and simple control measures to reduce particulate inhalation might reduce the incidence of invasive bacterial disease in regions of the world exposed to high temperatures and increased airborne dust.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim,10.1016/j.jaci.2016.04.062,"Adolescent;*Air Pollutants;Animals;Child, Preschool;*Dust;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;*Meningitis, Bacterial/ep [Epidemiology];Mice;Niger/ep [Epidemiology];Pneumococcal Infections/im [Immunology];Risk Factors;Streptococcus pneumoniae;Temperature;0 (Air Pollutants);0 (Dust)",,

We controlled for temporal trends by using daily mortality data during 1993-1997. We estimated relative risks (RRs) with reference to the first day of the 50-day period. RESULTS: We estimated that there were 692 excess deaths from June 21, 1995, to August 10, 1995; 26% of these deaths were owing to mortality displacement.

To address this knowledge gap, our study aimed to assess the risk of hospital admission for dehydration or other heat-related illness following initiation of medicines. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis using prescription event symmetry analysis (PESA) of 6700 veterans with incident hospital admission for dehydration or heat-related illness (ICD-10-AM codes E86, X30, T67), between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2013. The main outcome measure was first ever hospital admission for dehydration or heat-related illness following initiation of commonly used medicines. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A significantly higher risk of incident hospital admission for dehydration or heat-related illness was observed following initiation of anticoagulants, cardiovascular medicines, NSAIDs, antipsychotics, antidepressants and anticholinergic agents. The risk of hospital admission for dehydration or heat-related illness ranged from 1.17 (SSRIs) to 2.79 (ACEI plus diuretic combination product). No significant association was observed between initiation of anticonvulsants, anti-Parkinson's agents, hypnotics, anxiolytics or antihistamines and hospital admission for dehydration or heat-related illness. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Many commonly used medicines were found to be associated with increased risk of hospitalization for dehydration or heat-related illness. Initiation of ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics had the highest risk. Prescribers and patients should be aware of the potential for medicines to be associated with increased risk of dehydration and heat-related illness.","Kalisch Ellett, L M     Pratt, N L     Le Blanc, V T     Westaway, K     Roughead, E E     eng     England     2016/07/06     J Clin Pharm Ther. 2016 Oct;41(5):503-7. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12418.

RESULTS: Main causes: On days of extreme heat, the risk of emergency hospital admission due to heat-related injuries, dehydration and other disorders of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance increased more than the risk of admission from other causes. Underlying conditions: Those with underlying mental and behavioural disorders, diseases of nervous and circulatory system, especially cardiac, diseases of respiratory system, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neoplasms and renal disease, especially renal failure, were more susceptible to an extreme heat event.

The prevalence of heat-related illness symptoms was 48%; symptoms included heavy sweating, weakness/fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps, headache, and vertigo. Factors associated with heat-related illness included women and clothing. Sugarcane farmers wearing two-layer shirts had a higher risk of heat-related illness. Farmers with fluid intake 3.1-5.0 liters per day had a 79% lower risk of heat-related illness. Our findings demonstrated that sugarcane farmers are at risk of heat-related illness.

In this study, we focus on the number of deaths attributable to abnormally high temperatures. Attributable deaths (AD) allows us to estimate how many lives can be saved by implementing adequate prevention. Methods: We analyzed the relationship between mortality and daily maximum temperature using the generalized linear model; PM10, ozone, humidity, holidays, and long-term time trends were selected as the confounding variables. We classified deaths according to ICD-10 code, and estimate relative risks, daily attributable fractions on threshold temperature. Based on these fractions, we calculated the total number of deaths attributable to high temperatures between May and September, from 2001-2009 in Seoul, Korea. Results: At a threshold temperature of 29.38°C, a rise in temperature of 1°C resulted in an increase in deaths from all causes (1.85%, 1.15-2.55); mental disorders (5.20%, 0.30-10.35); nervous system (5.07%, 0.26-10.11); cardiovascular diseases(CVD) (1.44%, 0.06-2.84); and accidental death (2.29%, 0.35-4.26).

The possible effects of high ambient temperature must be better understood, particularly in terms of certain diseases' sensitivity to heat (as reflected in relative risks [RR]) and the consequent disease burden (number or fraction of cases attributable to high temperatures), in order to manage the threat. PURPOSE: This study investigated the number of deaths attributable to abnormally high ambient temperatures in Seoul, South Korea, for a wide range of diseases. METHOD: The relationship between mortality and daily maximum temperature using a generalized linear model was analyzed. The threshold temperature was defined as the 90th percentile of maximum daily temperatures. Deaths were classified according to ICD-10 codes, and for each disease, the RR and attributable fractions were determined. Using these fractions, the total number of deaths attributable to daily maximum temperatures above the threshold value, from 1992 to 2009, was calculated. Data analyses were conducted in 2012-2013. RESULTS: Heat-attributable deaths accounted for 3,177 of the 271,633 deaths from all causes. Neurological (RR 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11) and mental and behavioral disorders (RR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had relatively high increases in the RR of mortality. The most heat-sensitive diseases (those with the highest RRs) were not the diseases that caused the largest number of deaths attributable to high temperatures. CONCLUSION: This study estimated RRs and deaths attributable to high ambient temperature for a wide variety of diseases. Prevention-related policies must account for both particular vulnerabilities (heat-sensitive diseases with high RRs) and the major causes of the heat mortality burden (common conditions less sensitive to high temperatures).",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim,10.1371/journal.pone.0118577,Cause of Death;*Heat Stress Disorders/mo [Mortality];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Linear Models;*Mental Disorders/et [Etiology];Mental Disorders/mo [Mortality];*Nervous System Diseases/et [Etiology];Nervous System Diseases/mo [Mortality];Republic of Korea/ep [Epidemiology];Urban Population/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];Hot Temperature;Korea,,

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between heat stroke and pre-existing medical conditions in South Korea. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted using data from a nationwide surveillance system for heat illnesses in 2012. Individuals with heat stroke were identified and compared to control subjects with mild heat illness such as heat exhaustion, heat edema, heat cramps, and heat syncope. Categories of pre-existing medical conditions included cardio/cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, neuropsychiatric disorder, and diabetes mellitus. Associations between heat stroke and pre-existing medical conditions were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 968 eligible patients, 178 (18.4%) presented with heat stroke. Patients with pre-existing medical conditions were relatively greater in the heat stroke group than in the control group (40.4% and 23.9%, respectively). Neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with an increased odds of heat stroke after adjustment for covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 7.69; 95% CI, 4.06-14.54). There were no significant relationships between heat stroke and other medical conditions (cardio/cerebrovascular disease: 0.66, 0.40-1.06; respiratory disease: 1.44, 0.35-5.89; diabetes mellitus: 1.16, 0.58-2.34). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with an increased risk of heat stroke.

To examine these relationships, we searched the Medical Health System Data Repository (MDR) for active duty service members (ADSM) who had at least one EHS during the years of 2008-2014. Incidence was identified using the International Classification of Disease 9th (ICD-9) Revision codes from deidentified electronic medical records. Over this time period, 2,529 ADSM experienced at least one episode of EHS, while 12% of these individuals experienced multiple events (≥2). Within one year preceding EHS, 20% of ADSM suffered a prior heat illness and 9% were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Individuals that suffered a prior heat injury (HI) were 16 times more likely to develop rhabdomyolysis (OR 16.07; 95% CI (11.32-22.81)). Thirty percent of ADSM were also diagnosed with at least one prior infection in the two months preceding EHS or in the seven days following the HI. Further, these individuals were more likely to have suffered a prior HI (OR 1.35; 95% CI (1.03-1.78)). Current medications, immunizations, and allergy diagnosis were then examined as risk factors (RF) for increased susceptibility to EHS. Prescriptions for antiinflammatories, anti-infection, and central nervous system agents were prescribed most often, with 33% of individuals taking at least one medication in the two week time period before EHS. Individuals prescribed anti-inflammatories (15%) were more likely to have experienced a prior HI (OR 0.36; 95% CI (0.24-0.55)). Interestingly, in the 30 day time period before EHS, 20% of individuals received at least one immunization. Unexpectedly, allergy diagnosis was identified as a risk factor for EHS, occurring in 19.5% of EHS patients. Episode length (EL) (time from clinical admission to release) was used as a gauge of EHS severity. Both prior HI and rhabdomyolysis extended EL (P<.001). Examination of specific organ failure(s) was used to identify tissues most compromised by EHS. Renal failure was most commonly reported, appearing in 30% of EHS cases. Known RFs for EHS such as time of year, elevated body mass index, and advanced age were confirmed.

However, there is a need for more quantitative information on factors affecting sensitivity to the adverse health effects, particularly in countries with cool summer temperatures. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated mortality risk related to heatwave days in Finland. Risk was examined by age, sex, cause of death, and place of death, including health and social care facilities and homes. Mortality was also analysed for different patient subgroups in healthcare facilities. METHODS: Heatwaves were defined as periods when the daily average temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of that from May to August in 2000-2014 for >=4 days. In addition to all heatwave days, risk was analysed for short (4-5 days) and long (>=10 days) heatwaves. Mortality analyses were based on linking registry data on i) daily non-accidental and cause-specific mortality and ii) admissions to a health or social care facility. Statistical analyses were conducted using generalised estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis, assuming a Poisson distribution for the daily mortality count. RESULTS: During all heatwave days, mortality increased among those aged 65-74 years (6.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.9-10.8%) and >=75 years (12.8%, 95% CI 9.8-15.9%). Mortality increased in both sexes, but the risk was higher in women. Positive associations were observed for deaths due to respiratory diseases, renal diseases, mental and behavioural disorders, diseases of the nervous system, and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, effects were stronger for long than short heatwaves. During all heatwave days, mortality increased in healthcare facilities in outpatients (26.9%, 95% CI 17.3-37.2%) and inpatients. Among inpatients, the risk was higher in long-term inpatients (stay in ward > 30 days, 13.1%, 95% CI 8.6-17.7%) than others (5.8%, 95% CI 2.7-9.0%). At homes, mortality increased by 8.1% (95% CI 1.9-14.6%). Elevated risk estimates were also detected for social care facilities. CONCLUSIONS: In Finland, a cold-climate Northern country, heatwaves increase mortality risk significantly among the elderly. Women are more susceptible than men, and many chronic diseases are important risk factors. To reduce heatwave-related deaths, preparedness should be improved particularly in hospital and healthcare centre wards, where the most vulnerable are long-term inpatients. However, measures are also needed to protect the elderly at home and in social care facilities, especially during prolonged hot periods.","Kollanus, Virpi     Tiittanen, Pekka     Lanki, Timo     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2021/06/19     Environ Res. 2021 Oct;201:111503. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111503.

Individual and contextual characteristics can affect population vulnerabilities to COPD hospitalisation due to heat exposure. This study quantifies the effect of ambient heat on COPD hospitalisations and examines population vulnerabilities by age, sex and contextual characteristics. METHODS: Individual data on COPD hospitalisation at high geographical resolution (postcodes) during 2007-2018 in England was retrieved from the small area health statistics unit. Maximum temperature at 1 km x1 km resolution was available from the UK Met Office. We employed a case-crossover study design and fitted Bayesian conditional Poisson regression models. We adjusted for relative humidity and national holidays, and examined effect modification by age, sex, green space, average temperature, deprivation and urbanicity. RESULTS: After accounting for confounding, we found 1.47% (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 1.19% to 1.73%) increase in the hospitalisation risk for every 1degreeC increase in temperatures above 23.2degreeC (lags 0-2 days). We reported weak evidence of an effect modification by sex and age. We found a strong spatial determinant of the COPD hospitalisation risk due to heat exposure, which was alleviated when we accounted for contextual characteristics. 1851 (95% CrI 1 576 to 2 079) COPD hospitalisations were associated with temperatures above 23.2degreeC annually.

In the present study, we examine the association between high ambient air temperature and cardiovascular as well as respiratory mortality for the population of the greater area of Thessaloniki, Greece, taking into account the role of particulate pollution as a potential confounder. Methods: A mixed Poisson regression model, using a quasi-likelihood function to account for potential over-dispersion in the outcome distribution given covariates, was combined with distributed lag non-linear models, to estimate the non-linear and lag patterns in the association between mortality and daily mean temperature from 1999 to 2012. Results: A direct heat effect was found, as the mortality risk increased sharply above the temperature threshold of 33 degrees C, suggesting a significant effect of high temperatures on mortality on the same and next day of the heat events (lags 0-1) which was retained for a week, whereas a harvesting effect was noticed for the following days. Cardiovascular and respiratory mortality risk increased by 4.4% (95% CI 2.7%-6.1%) and 5.9% (95% CI 1.8%-10.3%) respectively on the same and following day of a heat event, whereas the risk dropped steeply in the following days. Particulate matter did not confound the association between high temperature and mortality in this population. Conclusion: There is a significant association between mortality and hot temperatures in Thessaloniki, Greece. Reduction in exposure to increased temperatures, as part of prevention measures and strategies, should be considered for vulnerable subpopulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Need for such research evidence is urgently needed to address this issue especially in the changing climate scenario. Objective To investigate the relationship between occupational heat stress, physiological indicators of heat strain, and associated renal health outcomes among brick workers in South India. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 327 brick workers during the summer of 2017 & 2018. We collected Wet Bulb Globe Temperatures (WBGT°C), pre-and post-shift Core Body Temperature(CBT), Urine Specific Gravity(USG), and post-shift Sweat rate(SwR), and serum creatinine/uric acid for calculating eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate), a kidney function indicator. Results Workers were exposed to an average WBGT of 27.7°C ±2.2 with more than 51% of measurements above the ACGIH-Threshold Limit Value (TLV). 69% of the workers reported heat-strain symptoms such as excessive sweating, exhaustion, and headaches. The workers exposed to above TLV-WBGT had 1.8-fold higher risk of dehydration (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR):1.8; 95%CI: 1.0-3.0, p=0.03), rise in CBT (AOR=2.2, CI: 1.0-4.7, p=0.02) and measured heat-related symptoms (AOR=2.5, 95%CI: 1.5-4.2, p=0.0001).

Objectives: To determine whether heat-sensitizing medications, e.g., diuretics, antipsychotics, increase the risk of heat-related hospitalizations during the warm summer months among older adults with debilitating conditions. Methods: Linking 20% US Medicare Part A, B, and D data with daily maximum surface air temperature (tasmax) using residence ZIP codes, we identified patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes on chronic insulin use (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke during June-August of years 2007-2012. We assessed exposure to angiotensin blockers (ACE/ARB), loop diuretics (LD), antipsychotics (AP), beta-blockers (BB), and anticholinergic agents (AC). We defined heatwaves as at least two consecutive days with tasmax >95th percentile. We assessed heat-related hospitalizations (heat exhaustion, heat fatigue, heatstroke, dehydration, hyperosmolality, or excessive exertion) during follow-up. We conducted self-controlled case series analysis for censored or curtailed data to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for heatwave and medication effects. We evaluated each medication separately, both overall in the full cohort and in each disease-specific cohort. Results: Among 377,100 patients (73% female; 80% white; mean age = 80, SD 8; 41% living in South region; 42% CKD, 29% dementia, 26% HF, 19% DM, 12% MI, 9% COPD, 7% stroke), 33% experienced a heatwave. A heat-related hospitalization occurred in 11,244 (3%). Heatwaves were associated with modest increases in heat-related hospitalizations (RR 1.1 [1.0-1.2]). Medication exposure varied widely ranging from 9% (AP) to 75% (AC). After accounting for heatwaves, several drug classes moderately increased the risk for heat-related hospitalizations except for AC and AP: BB, 1.3 (1.1-1.6); LD, 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) and ACE/ARB RR = 1.6 (1.3-1.9). The effects of ACE/ARB and LD were pronounced in subgroups with CKD, DM, and HF, with RR >5 and lower CI bound >2. Conclusions: Many of the heat-sensitizing medications increased the risk of heat-related hospitalizations among older patients with chronic disease.

This study describes some of the medical admissions that came to a major tertiary hospital in Adelaide during this time. Aims: To assess the vulnerability of patients with psychotic illness compared to the rest of the population, and to identify possible associated factors, issues for prevention and areas for further study. Methods: A retrospective descriptive analysis was carried out on a case series of patients admitted with heat-related illnesses to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Department of General Medicine during an exceptional heatwave from 27/1/2009-9/2/2009. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected. Results: A total of 52 patients were identified as being admitted with heatrelated illnesses. The majority of admissions occurred in the first week of the heatwave. Nine patients (17%) had a history of psychotic illness. These patients tended to be younger, had a longer length of stay (7.27 days vs. 4.67 days), were less likely to have sufficient air-conditioning and a greater proportion experienced heat stroke (44% vs. 26%).

All-cause deaths per day for the entire population were examined over the summer months (May-September) of 1991-2010. Daily deaths were standardized to account for long-term trends of subcycles (annual, seasonal, and weekly) at the mid-latitudes. In addition, a mortality prediction model was constructed through multiple stepwise regression to develop a heat-health warning system based on synoptic climatology. The result showed that dry tropical (DT) days during early summer caused excess mortality due to non-acclimatization by inhabitants, and moist tropical (MT) plus and double plus resulted in greater spikes of excess mortality due to extremely hot and humid conditions. Among the 14 Korean cities, highly excess mortality for the elderly was observed in Incheon (23.2%, 95%CI 5.6), Seoul (15.8%, 95%CI 2.6), and Jeonju (15.8%, 95%CI 4.6). No time lag effect was observed, and excess mortality gradually increased with time and hot weather simultaneously. The model showed weak performance as its predictions were underestimated for the validation period (2011-2015).

Also, most of previous studies focused only on the mortality risks for heat waves or cold spells for certain time period not considering its temporal changes and increasing frequencies. This study investigated the change in risks of mortality from heat waves and cold spells over time, and estimated the temporal changes in mortality burden attributed to heat waves and cold spells in Korea and Japan. We collected time-series data covering mortality and weather variables from 53 communities in the two countries from 1992 to 2015. Two-stage time-series regression with a time-varying distributed lag model and meta-analysis was used to assess the impacts of heat waves and cold spells by period (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). In total population, the risks of heat waves have decreased over time; however their mortality burden increased in the 2010s compared to the 2000s with increasing frequency. On the other hand, the risk and health burden of cold spells have increased over the decades. Our findings showed that the future mortality burden of heat waves and cold spells might not decrease, when considering their changes in risks and frequencies.","Lee, Whanhee     Choi, Hayon Michelle     Lee, Jae Young     Kim, Da Hye     Honda, Yasushi     Kim, Ho     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2018/04/22     Environ Int. 2018 Jul;116:136-146. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2018.04.017.

In particular, military-relevant large-scale studies of daily heat stress morbidity responses among physically active, working-age adults to various indices of heat have been limited. We evaluated daily means, maximums, minimums, and early morning measures of temperature, heat index, and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) indices, assessing their association with 31,642 case-definition heat stroke and heat exhaustion encounters among active duty servicemembers diagnosed at 24 continental US installations from 1998 to 2019. We utilized anonymized encounter data consisting of hospitalizations, ambulatory (out-patient) visits, and reportable events to define heat stress illness cases and select the 24 installations with the highest case counts. We derived daily indices of heat from hourly-scale gridded climate data and applied a case-crossover study design incorporating distributed-lag, nonlinear models with 5 days of lag to estimate odds ratios at one-degree increments for each index of heat. All indices exhibited nonlinear odds ratios with short-term lag effects throughout observed temperature ranges. Responses were positive, monotonic, and exponential in nature, except for maximum daily WBGT, minimum daily temperature, temperature at 0600 h (local), and WBGT at 0600 h (local), which, while generally increasing, showed decreasing risk for the highest heat category days. The risk for a heat stress illness on a day with a maximum WBGT of 32.2 degreeC (90.0 degreeF) was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.82 - 2.05) times greater than on a day with a maximum WBGT of 28.6 degreeC (83.4 degreeF). The risk was 2.53 (2.36-2.71) times greater on days with a maximum heat index of 40.6 degreeC (105 degreeF) compared to 32.8 degreeC (91.0 degreeF).

This study aimed to examine the association between mortality and daily maximum (T<sub>max</sub>), mean (T<sub>mean</sub>), and minimum (T<sub>min</sub>) temperatures in warmer months; to explore threshold temperatures; and to identify optimal heat indicators and vulnerable populations. METHODS: Daily data on temperature and mortality were obtained for the period 2007-2013. Heat thresholds for condition-specific mortality were estimated using an observed/expected analysis. We used a generalised additive model with a quasi-Poisson distribution to examine the association between mortality and T<sub>max</sub>/T<sub>min</sub>/T<sub>mean</sub> values higher than the threshold values, after adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: T<sub>max</sub>/T<sub>mean</sub>/T<sub>min</sub> thresholds were 32/28/24degreeC for non-accidental deaths; 32/28/24degreeC for cardiovascular deaths; 35/31/26degreeC for respiratory deaths; and 34/31/28degreeC for diabetes-related deaths. For each 1degreeC increase in T<sub>max</sub>/T<sub>mean</sub>/T<sub>min</sub> above the threshold, the mortality risk of non-accidental-, cardiovascular-, respiratory, and diabetes-related death increased by 2.8/5.3/4.8%, 4.1/7.2/6.6%, 6.6/25.3/14.7%, and 13.3/30.5/47.6%, respectively. Thresholds for mortality differed according to health condition when stratified by sex, age, and education level. For non-accidental deaths, effects were significant in individuals aged >=65 years (relative risk=1.038, 95% confidence interval: 1.026-1.050), but not for those <=64 years. For most outcomes, women and people >=65 years were more vulnerable. CONCLUSION: High temperature significantly increases the risk of mortality in the population of Jinan, China. Climate change with rising temperatures may bring about the situation worse. Public health programs should be improved and implemented to prevent and reduce health risks during hot days, especially for the identified vulnerable groups.","Li, Jing     Xu, Xin     Yang, Jun     Liu, Zhidong     Xu, Lei     Gao, Jinghong     Liu, Xiaobo     Wu, Haixia     Wang, Jun     Yu, Jieqiong     Jiang, Baofa     Liu, Qiyong     eng     Netherlands     2017/05/04     Environ Res. 2017 Jul;156:657-664. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2017.04.020.

Methods: Data on daily MT and childhood BD between 2006 and 2012 were collected from the Bureau of Meteorology and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Hefei, Anhui Province, China. A Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to analyse the effects of temperature on childhood BD across different age and sex subgroups. Results: An increase in temperature was significantly associated with childhood BD, and each 1 degrees C increase corresponded to an increase of 1.58% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-2.71%] in the number of cases of BD. Children aged 0-5 years and girls were particularly sensitive to the effects of temperature. Conclusions: High temperatures may increase the risk of childhood BD in Hefei.

Thirty-three studies were included in the final analysis. Most studies found a short-term negative health impact of heat waves on morbidity. The elderly, children, and males were more vulnerable during heat waves, and the medical care demand increased for those with existing chronic diseases. Some social factors, such as lower socioeconomic status, can contribute to heat-susceptibility. In terms of study methods and heat wave definitions, there remain inconsistencies and uncertainties.

Methods: A panel of 270 children (7-12 years) with asthma was recruited from six Australian cities. They were asked to record their respiratory symptoms every day in the morning (for night-time symptoms) and evening (for daytime symptoms) for four weeks. Daily ambient temperature, relative humidity and air pollution data were obtained from fixed monitors nearby. A mixed logistic regression model was used to examine the effects of ambient temperature on respiratory symptoms adjusted for children's sex, age, standing height, weight and air pollution. Subjects were specified as random effects. Results: The relationships between ambient temperature and respiratory symptoms were linear. Increasing temperatures induced the risks of children's asthmatic symptoms, especially for ""wheeze/chest tightness"" and to a lesser extent for ""cough/phlegm"". The effects were acute and lasted for four days (lag 0-3) in general. With increasing ambient temperature, boys were more at risk than girls. Conclusions: High ambient temperature is a risk factor for respiratory symptoms in children with asthma. As ambient temperature increases, policies and strategies for rising temperatures will be necessary to protect asthmatic children. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Shanshan     Baker, Peter J     Jalaludin, Bin B     Guo, Yuming     Marks, Guy B     Denison, Lyn S     Williams, Gail M     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2014/07/02     Environ Res. 2014 Aug;133:239-45. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2014.05.032.

Heatwave intensity, which was classified into four levels according to the quartile of its values, was calculated by Tmax multiplied the duration of a heatwave. The excess risk of HS during heatwave with different intensity was analyzed. The Tmax threshold for HS was 34 degreeC in Chongqing. After adjusting for potential confounders, strong associations and age-specific lag effects between Tmax and daily HS occurrence were observed. The impacts of Tmax on total HS lasted for 7 days (lag0-6), with the highest excess risk (ER) value of 30.5% (95% CI 23.6 and 37.8%) on lag0 with each 1 degreeC increment in Tmax over the threshold. A slightly stronger temperature-HS association was detected in male compared to female. The population over 65 years had the highest ER and the younger adults aged 19-35 and 35-55 years also showed significant heat-HS associations. The number of daily cases increased with the increasing of duration of heatwave and the peak value occurred on the eleventh day of the heatwave. The excess risk of HS during the heatwave with 1 to 4 level of intensity increased by 2.54, 2.97, 5.61, and 11.3 times, respectively, as compared with that of non-heatwave. Extreme heat is becoming a huge threat to public health due to the strong temperature-HS associations in Chongqing. Climate change with increasing temperatures may make the situation worse. Our results can provide reference for developing and improving relevant public health strategies and early extreme weather and health warning system to prevent and reduce the health risks due to extreme weather and climate change in Chongqing.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jim,10.1007/s11356-017-8457-z,Adult;China/ep [Epidemiology];*Climate Change;Female;*Heat Stroke/ep [Epidemiology];Hot Temperature;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Temperature;Weather;Young Adult;Heat Stroke;China;Temperature,,

This study explored the association between ambient temperature and PTB in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: Data of daily singleton PTB, air pollution and meteorological variables from 2005 to 2011 were collected in Shenzhen. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to investigate the association of the low and high temperatures (1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles) with PTB. RESULTS: The median temperature was 24.5 degreeC and the 1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of daily mean temperatures were 9, 12.5, 29.9 and 30.7 degreeC, respectively. The prevalence of singleton PTB was 5.61 % in Shenzhen. The association between temperature and PTB was not linear. There was an immediate positive association of low temperature (1st and 5th percentiles) and a negative association of high temperature (95th and 99th percentiles) with PTB. The effect of low temperature 9 degreeC (1st) on PTB on the current day was stronger than that of 12.5 degreeC (5th), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.54 (95 % CI: 1.36-1.75) and 1.49 (95 % CI: 1.35-1.63), respectively. The cumulative RR (up to 30 days) of 9 and 12.5 degreeC was 1.72 (95 % CI: 1.28-2.33) and 1.96 (95 % CI: 1.60-2.39), respectively. The cumulative effects (up to 30 days) of high temperature (95th and 99th percentiles) on PTB were 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.60-0.80) and 0.62 (95 % CI: 0.52-0.74), respectively. The cumulative effect (up to 30 days) of low temperatures on vaginal delivery PTB was lower than that of the cesarean section PTB with an RR of 1.58 (95 % CI: 1.12-2.22) and 1.93 (95 % CI: 1.21-3.08), respectively.

Hence, diurnal temperature range (DTR) may cause higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for population vulnerable to thermal stress. In this study, we hypothesized an increase of DTR which was associated with cardiovascular-related hospital admission in Seoul, South Korea. Methods: Data of daily hospital admission counts of 6 cause-specific CVD diseases in Seoul were collected from Korea National Health Insurance Corporation during 2003-2006. CVD diseases were arrhythmia, cardiac disease, cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Results of time-series analysis and temperaturematched case-crossover design were compared. Associations in time-series analysis were evaluated using generalized linear model (glm) adjusted for confounding factors. In temperature-matched case-crossover design, control days were selected with temperature within ±1°C. Models included the first day of the month, day of the week, mean pressure, PM10, influenza, and relative humidity. Cause-specific effect of DTR was presented in percent change of risk. Results: Case-crossover design showed similar or greater effect than timeseries analysis did. For time-series analysis, hospital admission risk was increased by 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.4% for cardiac disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure, respectively, with an increase of 1°C DTR. Significant risk of CVD-related hospital admission occurred after 5-8 days of higher DTR, depending on the symptoms.

The main study goal was to examine the effect of temperature, particularly high temperature, on ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. We investigated the association between outdoor temperature and stroke mortality in four metropolitan cities in Korea during 1992-2007. We used time series analysis of the age-adjusted mortality rate for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke deaths by using generalized additive and generalized linear models, and estimated the percentage change of mortality rate associated with a 1degreeC increase of mean temperature. The temperature-responses for the hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke mortality differed, particularly in the range of high temperature. The estimated percentage change of ischemic stroke mortality above a threshold temperature was 5.4 % (95 % CI, 3.9-6.9 %) in Seoul, 4.1 % (95 % CI, 1.6-6.6 %) in Incheon, 2.3 % (-0.2 to 5.0 %) in Daegu and 3.6 % (0.7-6.6 %) in Busan, after controlling for daily mean humidity, mean air pressure, day of the week, season, and year. Additional adjustment of air pollution concentrations in the model did not change the effects. Hemorrhagic stroke mortality risk significantly decreased with increasing temperature without a threshold in the four cities after adjusting for confounders. These findings suggest that the mortality of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes show different patterns in relation to outdoor temperature.

However, none have examined the association between ambient temperature and acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to examine the association between daily mean temperature and AKI and identify high-risk subgroups in this association. We obtained health insurance claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) for 24,800 admitted cases of AKI during the period 2007–2014 in Seoul, Korea. Using a time-series design and piecewise linear regression models, we estimated the percentage change in AKI admissions associated with daily mean temperature after controlling for relevant covariates. Daily mean temperature and AKI admissions displayed an inverse association in the cold season and a nonlinear relationship with a flexion point around 28.8 °C in the warm season. AKI admissions increased by 23.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.3, 33.0) per 1 °C increase in mean temperature above the 28.8 °C flexion point in the warm season. The estimates were greatest among men with hypertension (55.1%; 95% CI: 25.1, 92.2). However, we did not observe significant increases in AKI admissions associated with ambient temperature in the cold season (0.4% [95% CI: − 0.1, 0.9] per 1 °C decrease in mean temperature). Our results suggest that hospital admissions for AKI increase in association with high temperature, particularly among men with hypertension in the warm season. Thus, early detection of AKI during heat wave periods is crucial. Our findings also provide evidence for the local government to target populations vulnerable to high ambient temperatures.","Lim, Youn-Hee     So, Rina     Lee, Choongho     Hong, Yun-Chul     Park, Minseon     Kim, Logyoung     Yoon, Hyung-Jin     eng     Netherlands     2017/11/02     Sci Total Environ. 2018 Mar;616-617:1134-1138. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.207.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective time-series analysis to investigate effects of weather conditions on hospitalizations for gastrointestinal infections (GIH) in New York State in July and August from 1991 to 2004. Applying generalized additive model (GAM), we evaluated the associations between daily GIH count and multiple weather factors including temperature, humidity, and precipitation (0-10 lag days), adjusting for long term trend, seasonality, and calendar effects. Results: Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum universal apparent temperature (UAT) showed that each °C increase in temperature was significantly associated with an increase (0.70-0.96%) in daily GIH count, with the greatest impacts observed at lag 1. Extreme heat (EH: >. 90th percentile) (3.68% at lag 1) and precipitation (0.31% at lag 4) showed larger impacts on increases of GIH and a clear dose-response relationship for EH. Stratified analyses showed that the impacts of extreme heat on GIH tend to be greater among Hispanics, blacks, females, and those with bacterial infections. Conclusion: We found that high maximum and minimum temperature, UAT, precipitation, and extreme heat in summer significantly increased the risks of GIH in NYS. Our findings also suggest that bacteria might be a significant cause for GIH in the summer, and minority, female and those with bacterial infection may be more vulnerable to heat's effects on GIH.","Lin, Shao     Sun, Mingzeng     Fitzgerald, Edward     Hwang, Syni-An     eng     U01EH000396-02/EH/NCEH CDC HHS/     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Eight high-temperature indices, including three single measurements (average, maximum and minimum temperature) and five composite indices (heat index, humidex, temperature humidity index, apparent temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature), and their standardized Z scores, were used in distributed lag non-linear models. Cumulative 8-day (lag zero to seven days) relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated, 1 and 2 standardized deviations above the medium (i.e., at 84.1th and 97.7th percentile, respectively), by comparing with Z scores for the lowest risks of mortality and outpatient visits as references. Analyses were performed for Taipei in north, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan. Results showed that standardized Z-values of high-temperature indices associated with the lowest health risk were approximately 0 in Taipei and Central Taiwan, and -1 in Southern Taiwan. As the apparent temperature was at Z=2, the cumulative 8-day mortality risk increased significantly, by 23% in Taipei and 28% in Southern Taiwan, but not in Central Taiwan. The maximum temperature displayed consistently a high correlation with all-cause outpatient visits at Z=1; with the cumulative 8-day RRs for outpatient visits increased by 7%, 3%, and 4% in the three corresponding areas. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated methods to compare multiple high-temperature indices associated with all-cause mortality and outpatient visits for population residing in a subtropical island.

In addition, the modifying effects of socio-economic and environmental factors on temperature-health associations were also evaluated. Methods: A distributed lag non-linear model was applied to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RRs) with confidence intervals of all-cause mortality, ERVs, and outpatient visits associated with extreme temperature events. Random-effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled RR of all-cause mortality, ERVs, and outpatient visits influenced by socio-economic and environmental factors. Results: Temperature-related risks varied with study area and health outcome. Meta-analysis showed greater all-cause mortality risk occurred in low temperatures than in high temperatures. Integrated RR of all-cause mortality was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-2.04) in the 5th percentile temperature and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05-1.15) in the 95th percentile temperature, while the lowest mortality risk was in the 60th percentile temperature (22.2 degrees C). Risk for ERVs increased when temperature increased (RR was 1.21 [95% CI: 1.17-1.26] in 95th percentile temperature), but risk of outpatient visits increased at low temperatures (RR was 1.06 [95% CI: 1.01-1.12] in the 5th percentile temperature). Certain socio-economic factors significantly modified low-temperature-related mortality risks, including number of employed populations, elders living alone from lower-income families, and public and medical services. Conclusions: This study found that mortality and outpatient visits were higher at low temperature, while ERVs risk was higher at high temperature. Future plans for public health and emerging medical services responding to extreme temperatures should consider regional and integrated evaluations of temperature-related health risks and modifying factors.

The use of certain neuroleptic medications to control some of this disease's complications would appear to be related to an increase in heat-related mortality. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationship and quantify the short-term effect of high temperatures during heat wave episodes in Madrid on daily mortality and PD-related hospital admissions. METHODS: We used an ecological time-series study and fit Poisson regression models. We analysed the daily number of deaths due to PD and the number of daily PD-related emergency hospital admissions in the city of Madrid, using maximum daily temperature (degreeC) as the main environmental variable and chemical air pollution as covariates. We controlled for trend, seasonalities, and the autoregressive nature of the series. RESULTS: There was a maximum daily temperature of 30degreeC at which PD-related admissions were at a minimum. Similarly, a temperature of 34degreeC coincides with an increase in the number of admissions. For PD-related admissions, the Relative Risk (RR) for every increase of 1degreeC above the threshold temperature was 1.13 IC95%:(1.03-1.23) at lags 1 and 5; and for daily PD-related mortality, the RR was 1.14 IC95%:(1.01-1.28) at lag 3. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that suffering from PD is a risk factor that contributes to the excess morbidity and mortality associated with high temperatures, and is relevant from the standpoint of public health prevention plans.","Linares, Cristina     Martinez-Martin, Pablo     Rodriguez-Blazquez, Carmen     Forjaz, Maria Joao     Carmona, Rocio     Diaz, Julio     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2016/01/30     Environ Int. 2016 Apr-May;89-90:1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2016.01.017.

The spatio-temporal synchronization between peaks in disease manifestation and high temperature provides important insights into the seasonal timing of the heatwave and the response it may cause with respect to emergence, severity, and duration. The objectives of this study are to examine the association between hospitalizations due to heat stroke in older adults and heat in the United States (US) and explore synchronization with respect to heatwave sequence, time of arrival, and regional climate. Three large data sets were utilized: daily hospitalization records of the US elderly between 1991 and 2006, annual demographic summaries on Medicare beneficiaries maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and nationwide daily meteorological observations. We modeled seasonal fluctuations in health outcomes, such as the timing and intensity of the seasonal peak in hospitalizations using refined harmonic GLM for eight climatically similar regions. During the 16-year study period, there were 40,019 heat-related hospitalizations (HRH) in the conterminous US. The rates of HRH varied substantially across eight climatic regions: with the highest rate of 7.05 cases per million residents observed in areas with temperate arid summers and winters (TaTa) and the lowest rate of 0.67in areas with cold moderately dry summers and arid winters (CdCa), where summer temperatures are about 18.3 degrees C and 12.1 degrees C, respectively. We detected 400 heatwaves defined as any day when the night time temperature is above its 90th percentile for the current and previous nights. The first seasonal heatwave in a season resulted in 4274 hospitalizations over 342 heatwave-days: 34.3% of 12,442 hospitalizations occurred in 26% of 1308 heatwave-days. The relative risks of increased HRH associated with the first and second heatwaves were 10.4 (95%CI: 8.5; 12.3) and 11.4 (95%CI: 9.6; 13.3), respectively, indicating the disproportional effects of early heatwave arrivals. The seasonal spike in heat stroke hospitalizations in regions with relatively similar annual temperatures, e.g. in areas with temperate moderately dry summers and winters (TdTa: 12.8 degrees C) and (TaTa: 11.1 degrees C) ranged between 4.5 (95%CI: 3.3; 5.5) and 11.0 (95%CI: 8.2; 14.9) cases per million residents, respectively, indicating substantial regional differences. The differences in heat-related hospitalizations and response to heatwaves are substantial among older adults residing in different climate regions of the conterminous US.

The implementation of effective prevention measures requires a better understanding of the risk factors that increase susceptibility. To fill gaps in knowledge, this study reviews the current literature on the effects of heat on kidney-disease outcomes (ICD-10 N00-N39), including morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Databases were systematically searched for relevant literature published between 1990 and 2020 and the quality of evidence evaluated. We performed random effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled relative risks (RRs) of the association between high temperatures (and heatwaves) and kidney disease outcomes. We further evaluated vulnerability concerning contextual population characteristics. RESULTS: Of 2739 studies identified, 91 were reviewed and 82 of these studies met the criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Findings showed that with a 1 degreeC increase in temperature, the risk of kidney-related morbidity increased by 1% (RR 1.010; 95% CI: 1.009-1.011), with the greatest risk for urolithiasis. Heatwaves were also associated with increased morbidity with a trend observed with heatwave intensity. During low-intensity heatwaves, there was an increase of 5.9% in morbidity, while during high-intensity heatwaves there was a 7.7% increase. There were greater RRs for males, people aged <=64 years, and those living in temperate climate zones. Similarly, for every 1 degreeC temperature increase, there was a 3% (RR 1.031; 95% CI: 1.018-1.045) increase in the risk of kidney-related mortality, which also increased during heatwaves. CONCLUSIONS: High temperatures (and heatwaves) are associated with an elevated risk of kidney disease outcomes, particularly urolithiasis. Preventive measures that may minimize risks in vulnerable individuals during hot spells are discussed.","Liu, Jingwen     Varghese, Blesson M     Hansen, Alana     Borg, Matthew A     Zhang, Ying     Driscoll, Timothy     Morgan, Geoffrey     Dear, Keith     Gourley, Michelle     Capon, Anthony     Bi, Peng     eng     Meta-Analysis     Review     Systematic Review     Netherlands     2021/09/02     Sci Total Environ. 2021 Dec 20;801:149806. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149806.

Warming temperatures might therefore pose substantial challenges to population health, especially in a rapidly aging population. To address a potential increase in the burden of cardiovascular disease, a better understanding of the effects of ambient heat on different types of cardiovascular disease and factors contributing to vulnerability is required, especially in the context of climate change. This study reviews the current epidemiological evidence linking heat exposures (both high temperatures and heatwaves) with cardiovascular disease outcomes, including mortality and morbidity. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for literature published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 10, 2022, and evaluated the quality of the evidence following the Navigation Guide Criteria. We included original research on independent study populations in which the exposure metric was high temperatures or heatwaves, and observational studies using ecological time series, case crossover, or case series study designs comparing risks over different exposures or time periods. Reviews, commentaries, grey literature, and studies that examined only seasonal effects without explicitly considering temperature were excluded. The risk estimates were derived from included articles and if insufficient data were available we contacted the authors to provide clarification. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) of the association between high temperatures and heatwaves and cardiovascular disease outcomes. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021232601). Findings In total, 7360 results were returned from our search of which we included 282 articles in the systematic review, and of which 266 were eligible for the meta-analysis. There was substantial heterogeneity for both mortality (high temperatures: I-2 =93.6%, p<0.0001; heatwaves: I-2=98.9%, p<0.0001) and morbidity (high temperatures: I-2=98.8%, p<0. 0001; heatwaves: I-2=83 - 5%, p<0.0001). Despite the heterogeneity in environmental conditions and population dynamics among the reviewed studies, results showed that a 1 degrees C increase in temperature was positively associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality across all considered diagnoses. The overall risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality increased by 2.1% (RR 1.021 [95%CI 1. 020-1. 023]), with the highest specific disease risk being for stroke and coronary heart disease. A 1 degrees C temperature rise was also associated with a significant increase in morbidity due to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest and coronary heart disease. Our findings suggest heat exposure leads to elevated risk of morbidity and mortality for women, people 65 years and older, individuals living in tropical climates, and those in countries of lower-middle income. Heatwaves were also significantly associated with a 17% increase in risk of mortality (RR 1.117 [95% CI 1- 093-1.141]), and increasing heatwave intensity with an increasing risk (RR 1.067 [95% CI 1.056-1.0781 for low intensity, 1.088 [1.058-1.119] for middle intensity, and 1.189 [1.109-1.269] for high intensity settings). Interpretation This review strengthens the evidence on the increase in cardiovascular disease risk due to ambient heat exposures in different climate zones. The widespread prevalence of exposure to hot temperatures, in conjunction with an increase in the proportion of older people in the population, might result in a rise in poor cardiovascular disease health outcomes associated with a warming climate. Evidence-based prevention measures are needed to attenuate peaks in cardiovascular events during hot spells, thereby lowering the worldwide total heat-related burden of cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and death.

Our study aimed at investigating the association between daily air temperature and daily cardiovascular as well as respiratory mortality in the urban area of Beijing, China. Methods: Daily death counts for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases for adult residents (≥15 years) and meteorological parameters were obtained from local authorities from January 2003 to August 2005. Confounder-adjusted semiparametric Poisson regression models were used to estimate the effects of 2-day and 15-day temperature averages. Time trend and relative humidity were forced in every model. Exposureresponse curves for temperature were estimated using penalized regression splines. Moreover, we analyzed the associations between temperature and mortality for the potentially more susceptible subgroup of elderly people (≥65 years). Effects are presented as relative risk (RR) for mortality per 5°C change in the whole temperature range if the shape of the exposureresponse curve was linear, or, if non-linear, for the slopes above a temperature threshold. Results: We observed J-shaped exposure-response relationships between 2-day average temperature and cardiovascular mortality with a temperature threshold of 23°C. For respiratory mortality, the relationships were considered linear. Overall, a 5°C increase of the 2-day average temperature was associated with a RR of 1.017 (95% confidence-interval [CI]: 1.008 -1.027) and 1.143 (95% CI: 1.089 -1.199) for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. For elderly people, the associations were weaker for respiratory mortality, but stronger for cardiovascular mortality. Regarding cold effects, a 5°C decrease of the 15-day average temperature was associated with a RR of 1.036 (95% CI: 1.001-1.071) for cardiovascular mortality. Elderly people showed again a similar effect. Conclusion: Heat as well as cold effects were found for the association of air temperature with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.

Objectives: To explore the effects of temperature-pollution interactions during pre-and post-natal periods on asthma among pre-schoolers. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 39,782 pre-schoolers was performed during 2010-2012, in seven cities in China. Exposure to three temperature indicators (TI) and three critical ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as proxies of industrial and vehicular air pollution, was estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. Two-level logistical regression analysis was used to examine the association between both pre-and post-natal exposure and childhood asthma in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI). Results: Asthma prevalence in pre-schoolers at age of 3-6 years (6.9 %) was significantly associated with traffic -related air pollutant (NO2) exposure, with ORs (95 % CI) of 1.17 (1.06, 1.28), 1.19 (1.05-1.34) and 1.16 (1.03-1.31) for an IQR increase in NO2 exposure during lifetime, pregnancy, and entire postnatal period respectively. Furthermore, childhood asthma was positively associated with exposure to increased temperature during lifetime, pregnancy, and entire postnatal period with ORs (95 % CI) = 1.89 (1.66, 2.16), 1.47 (1.34, 1.61), and 1.15 (1.11, 1.18) respectively, while was negatively associated with decreased temperatures. Childhood asthma was positively related with exposure to extreme heat days (EHD) during postnatal period particularly in first year of life respectively with ORs (95 % CI) = 1.23 (1.04, 1.46) and 1.26 (1.07, 1.47), but was not related with extreme cold days (ECD) exposure. A combination of high air pollutant levels and high temperatures significantly increased the risk of asthma during both pre-and post-natal periods. Strikingly, we found a significantly positive interaction of temperature and PM10 or SO2 on asthma risk among boys and younger children. Conclusions: Prenatal and postnatal exposure to ambient air pollution and high temperatures are independently and jointly associated with asthma risk in early childhood.","Lu, Chan     Zhang, Yinping     Li, Baizhan     Zhao, Zhuohui     Huang, Chen     Zhang, Xin     Qian, Hua     Wang, Juan     Liu, Wei     Sun, Yuexia     Norback, Dan     Deng, Qihong     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2022/08/12     Environ Int. 2022 Sep;167:107456. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2022.107456.

A total of 238 427 de-identified hospitalization records for renal disease were collected from Queensland Health. Meteorological data was obtained from the Scientific Information for Land Owners. Summer season means four consecutive months with higher daily mean temperatures. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study using conditional quasi-Poisson regression model and applied a time-varying distributed lag non-linear model were used to evaluate the temporal trends of the associations between 1 degrees C increase in daily mean temperatures (over 0-10 lags) and hospitalizations for renal diseases. We also conducted stratified analyses by sex, age, climate zone, socioeconomic status, and cause-specific renal diseases. Overall, the associations between high temperature and hospitalizations for renal diseases showed a decreasing trend during the summer seasons from 1995 to 2016. However, the heat-related effects in males increased from 3.0% (95% CI: 2.2%, 3.9%) in 1995 to 4.8% (95% CI: 3.9%, 5.6%) in 2016.

However, there are limited existing studies that have examined the relationship between high temperatures and urologic disease. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between heat exposure and hospitalizations for urologic diseases in Queensland, Australia, during the hot seasons of 1995-2016 and to quantify the attributable risks. Methods We obtained 238 427 hospitalized cases with urologic diseases from Queensland Health between 1 December 1995 and 31 December 2016. Meteorological data were collected from the Scientific Information for Land Owners-a publicly accessible database of Australian climate data that provides daily data sets for a range of climate variables. A time-stratified, case-crossover design fitted with the conditional quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate the associations between temperature and hospitalizations for urologic diseases at the postcode level during each hot season (December-March). Attributable rates of hospitalizations for urologic disease due to heat exposure were calculated. Stratified analyses were performed by age, sex, climate zone, socio-economic factors and cause-specific urologic diseases. Results We found that a 1 degrees C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9%, 3.7%] increase in hospitalization for the selected urologic diseases during the hot season. Hospitalizations for renal failure showed the strongest increase 5.88% (95% CI: 5.25%, 6.51%) among the specific causes of hospital admissions considered. Males and the elderly (>= 60 years old) showed stronger associations with heat exposure than females and younger groups. The sex- and age-specific associations with heat exposure were similar across specific causes of urologic diseases. Overall, nearly one-fifth of hospitalizations for urologic diseases were attributable to heat exposure in Queensland. Conclusions Heat exposure is associated with increased hospitalizations for urologic disease in Queensland during the hot season. This finding reinforces the pressing need for dedicated public health-promotion campaigns that target susceptible populations, especially for those more predisposed to renal failure. Given that short-term climate projections identify an increase in the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves, this public health advisory will be of increasing urgency in coming years.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Ashwin,10.1093/ije/dyab189,Increasing temperatures;hospitalization;urologic disease;attributable;risks;Queensland;Australia;ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY;AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;ASSOCIATION;ADMISSIONS;IMPACT;Urologic Diseases,,

Results: A relationship between high temperatures and cardiovascular mortality was observed for cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic and other heart diseases; this relationship was exacerbated on days with high temperatures. The highest relative risk was observed on the day of the heat event and remained significantly elevated for another day. The results were consistent regardless whether the minimum, maximum, or mean temperatures were used, although the association seems to be more pronounced with the mean temperatures, which suggests that consecutive high day- and night-time temperatures are the most hazardous.

A multi-city study covering different climatic zones is necessary to better understand regional differences in temperature risk on mortality in China. Methods: Sixty-six communities from 7 regions across China were included in this study. We first used a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to estimate community-specific effects of temperature on non-accidental mortality during 2006-2011. A multivariate meta-analysis was then applied to pool the estimates of community-specific effects. Results: A U-shaped curve was observed between temperature and mortality at the national level in China, indicating both low and high temperatures were associated with increased mortality risk. The overall threshold was at about the 75th percentile of the pooled temperature distribution. The relative risk was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.48-1.74) for extremely cold temperature (1st percentile of temperature), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.10-1.34) for extreme hot temperature (99th percentile of temperature) at lag. 0-21 days. The temperature-mortality relationship is different for different regions. Compared with north China, south China had a higher minimum mortality temperature (MMT), and there was a larger cold effect in the more southern parts of China and a more pronounced hot effect in more northern parts. Conclusions: Both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk in China, and the relationship varies geographically. Our findings suggest that public health policies for climate change adaptation should be tailored to the local climate conditions.","Ma, Wenjun     Wang, Lijun     Lin, Hualiang     Liu, Tao     Zhang, Yonghui     Rutherford, Shannon     Luo, Yuan     Zeng, Weilin     Zhang, Yewu     Wang, Xiaofeng     Gu, Xin     Chu, Cordia     Xiao, Jianpeng     Zhou, Maigeng     eng     Meta-Analysis     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2014/12/10     Environ Res. 2015 Feb;137:72-7. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2014.11.016.

However, few have assessed the health impacts at a nation scale in a developing country. This study examines the mortality effects of heat waves in China and explores whether the effects are modified by individual-level and community-level characteristics. METHODS: Daily mortality and meteorological variables from 66 Chinese communities were collected for the period 2006-2011. Heat waves were defined as >=2 consecutive days with mean temperature >=95th percentile of the year-round community-specific distribution. The community-specific mortality effects of heat waves were first estimated using a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM), adjusting for potential confounders. To investigate effect modification by individual characteristics (age, gender, cause of death, education level or place of death), separate DLNM models were further fitted. Potential effect modification by community characteristics was examined using a meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 5.0% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.9%-7.2%) excess deaths were associated with heat waves in 66 Chinese communities, with the highest excess deaths in north China (6.0%, 95% CI: 1%-11.3%), followed by east China (5.2%, 95% CI: 0.4%-10.2%) and south China (4.5%, 95% CI: 1.4%-7.6%). Our results indicate that individual characteristics significantly modified heat waves effects in China, with greater effects on cardiovascular mortality, cerebrovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, the elderly, females, the population dying outside of a hospital and those with a higher education attainment. Heat wave mortality effects were also more pronounced for those living in urban cities or densely populated communities. CONCLUSION: Heat waves significantly increased mortality risk in China with apparent spatial heterogeneity, which was modified by some individual-level and community-level factors. Our findings suggest adaptation plans that target vulnerable populations in susceptible communities during heat wave events should be developed to reduce health risks.","Ma, Wenjun     Zeng, Weilin     Zhou, Maigeng     Wang, Lijun     Rutherford, Shannon     Lin, Hualiang     Liu, Tao     Zhang, Yonghui     Xiao, Jianpeng     Zhang, Yewu     Wang, Xiaofeng     Gu, Xin     Chu, Cordia     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2014/12/03     Environ Int. 2015 Feb;75:103-9. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2014.11.004.

Vulnerability to extreme heat has previously been identified and mapped in urban areas to improve heat morbidity and mortality prevention efforts. However, only limited work has examined vulnerability outside of urban locations. This study seeks to broaden the geographic context of earlier work and compute heat vulnerability across the state of Georgia, which offers diverse landscapes and populations with varying sociodemographic characteristics. Here, a modified heat vulnerability index (HVI) developed by Reid et al. is used to characterize vulnerability by county. About half of counties with the greatest heat vulnerability index scores contain the larger cities in the state (i.e., Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, and Savannah), while the other half of high-vulnerability counties are located in more rural counties clustered in southwestern and east-central Georgia. The source of vulnerability varied between the more urban and rural high-vulnerability counties, with poverty and population of nonwhite residents driving vulnerability in the more urban counties and social isolation/population of elderly/poor health the dominant factor in the more rural counties. Additionally, the effectiveness of the HVI in identifying vulnerable populations was investigated by examining the effect of modification of the vulnerability index score with mortality during extreme heat. Except for the least vulnerable categories, the relative risk of mortality increases with increasing vulnerability.

Outdoor heat has been associated with increased mortality and increases in COPD hospitalizations in population studies. Less is known about individual-level exposure to heat and the impact on disease-specific outcomes. We sought to investigate the effect of heat exposure on symptoms, lung function, and rescue medication use in a cohort of former smokers with COPD. METHODS: Former smokers with moderate-severe COPD underwent week-long observation periods at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Daily in-home and outdoor temperature monitoring was performed and participants simultaneously completed daily assessment of symptoms (Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS)), rescue inhaler use, and lung function (PiKO device). Visits during the warm season, defined as the first through last day with a maximum outdoor temperature >90 F, were included. Random effects modeling analysis was used and models were adjusted for age, sex, education, and FEV1% predicted or pack-years, as appropriate. RESULTS: Subjects with COPD (n=84) were older (69+7 years), Caucasian (88%), male (58%), former smokers (57 + 29 pack-years) with moderate-severe COPD (baseline FEV1 49+16 % predicted, FEV1/FVC 51+10 %). Participant had 602 days of monitoring during the warm season and reported going outdoors 48% of days (average outdoor time 2.0 + 2.1hours on these days). Increases in indoor temperature were associated with increases in symptoms and rescue medication use and decreases in lung function (Table). Among days participants went outdoors, increases in maximum temperature were associated with increases in symptoms (BCSS β=0.37, p<001 per 10°F increase) and there was no relationship on days when participants did not go outdoors (β=-0.02, p=0.81; p-value interaction= 0.07). Outdoor temperature was not associated with medication use or lung function. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing indoor temperature was associated with disease-specific indicators of COPD morbidity, including increased symptoms, increased rescue medication use, and decreased lung function. Although participants spent most of their time indoors, outdoor temperature was associated with increased symptoms on days participants went outdoors. The findings of clinically significant changes in disease-specific indicators of COPD morbidity support the need for adaptive approaches to protect such individuals from adverse respiratory health effects of heat exposure which are projected to increase with the anticipated course of climate change.

Lower- to middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing some of the highest rates of these adverse birth outcomes. Research has suggested that environmental determinants, such as extreme heat, can increase the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. Under climate change, extreme heat events have become more severe and frequent and are occurring in differential seasonal patterns. Little is known about how extreme heat affects the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth in LMICs. Thus, it is imperative to examine how exposure to extreme heat affects adverse birth outcomes in regions with some of the highest rates of preterm and stillbirths. Most of the evidence linking extreme heat and adverse birth outcomes has been generated from high-income countries (HICs) notably because measuring temperature in LMICs has proven challenging due to the scarcity of ground monitors. The paucity of health data has been an additional obstacle to study this relationship in LMICs. In this study, globally gridded meteorological data was linked with spatially and temporally resolved Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data on adverse birth outcomes. A global analysis of 14 LMICs was conducted per a pooled time-stratified case-crossover design with distributed-lag nonlinear models to ascertain the relationship between acute exposure to extreme heat and PTB and stillbirths. We notably found that experiencing higher maximum temperatures and smaller diurnal temperature range during the last week before birth increased the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth. This study is the first global assessment of extreme heat events and adverse birth outcomes and builds the evidence base for LMICs.","McElroy, Sara     Ilango, Sindana     Dimitrova, Anna     Gershunov, Alexander     Benmarhnia, Tarik     eng     Netherlands     2021/10/10     Environ Int. 2022 Jan;158:106902. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106902.

However, whether this association generalizes to a northern climate, with more variable temperatures, is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Our study focused on older adults (mean age, 80 years) in the northern climate of Ontario, Canada. 52,913 case patients who had a hospital encounter with AKI in April through September 2005 to 2012 were matched with 174,222 controls for exact date, age, sex, rural residence, income, and history of chronic kidney disease. PREDICTOR: Heat periods were defined as 3 consecutive days exceeding the 95th percentile of area-specific maximum temperature. OUTCOMES: Hospital encounter (inpatient admission or emergency department visit) with a diagnosis of AKI. MEASUREMENTS: ORs (95% CIs) were used to assess the association between heat periods and AKI. To quantify the effect in absolute terms, we multiplied the population incidence rate of AKI in the absence of heat periods by our adjusted OR (an approximate of relative risk). RESULTS: Heat periods were significantly associated with higher risk for AKI (adjusted OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23). Heat periods in absolute terms were associated with an additional 182 cases of AKI per 100,000 person-years during the warm season. LIMITATIONS: We did not know how long persons were outside or if they had access to air conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: In a northern climate, periods of higher environmental heat were associated with a modestly higher risk for hospital encounter with AKI among older adults.","McTavish, Rebecca K     Richard, Lucie     McArthur, Eric     Shariff, Salimah Z     Acedillo, Rey     Parikh, Chirag R     Wald, Ron     Wilk, Piotr     Garg, Amit X     eng     Canadian Institutes of Health Research/International     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2017/10/28     Am J Kidney Dis. 2018 Feb;71(2):200-208. doi: 10.1053/j.ajkd.2017.07.011.

OBJECTIVES: We set out to identify subpopulations and mortality causes with increased susceptibility to temperature extremes. METHODS: We conducted a case-only analysis using daily mortality and hourly weather data from 50 U.S. cities for the period 1989-2000, covering a total of 7,789,655 deaths. We used distributions of daily minimum and maximum temperature in each city to define extremely hot days (>/= 99 th percentile) and extremely cold days (</= 1st percentile) , respectively. For each (hypothesized) effect modifier, a city-specific logistic regression model was fitted and an overall estimate calculated in a subsequent meta-analysis. RESULTS: Older subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 1.020 ; 95% confidence interval (CI) , 1.005-1.034], diabetics (OR = 1.035 ; 95% CI, 1.010-1.062) , blacks (OR = 1.037 ; 95% CI, 1.016-1.059) , and those dying outside a hospital (OR = 1.066 ; 95% CI, 1.036-1.098) were more susceptible to extreme heat, with some differences observed between those dying from a cardiovascular disease and other decedents. Cardiovascular deaths (OR = 1.053 ; 95% CI, 1.036-1.070) , and especially cardiac arrest deaths (OR = 1.137 ; 95% CI, 1.051-1.230) , showed a greater relative increase on extremely cold days, whereas the increase in heat-related mortality was marginally higher for those with coexisting atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.059 ; 95% CI, 0.996-1.125) .

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Peer-reviewed studies about the temperature and cardiovascular mortality were retrieved in the MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from January 2000 up to the end of 2015. The pooled effect sizes of short-term effect were calculated for the heat exposure and cold exposure separately. Also, we assessed the dose-response relationship of temperature-cardiovascular mortality by a change in units of latitudes, longitude, lag days and annual mean temperature by meta-regression. RESULT: After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts, a total of 26 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of cardiovascular mortality increased by 5% (RR, 1.055; 95% CI [1.050-1.060]) for the cold exposure and 1.3% (RR, 1.013; 95% CI [1.011-1.015]) for the heat exposure. The short-term effects of cold and heat exposure on the risk of cardiovascular mortality in males were 3.8% (RR, 1.038; 95% CI [1.034-1.043]) and 1.1%( RR, 1.011; 95% CI [1.009-1.013]) respectively. Moreover, the effects of cold and heat exposure on risk of cardiovascular mortality in females were 4.1% (RR, 1.041; 95% CI [1.037-1.045]) and 1.4% (RR, 1.014; 95% CI [1.011-1.017]) respectively. In the elderly, it was at an 8.1% increase and a 6% increase in the heat and cold exposure, respectively. The greatest risk of cardiovascular mortality in cold temperature was in the 14 lag days (RR, 1.09; 95% CI [1.07-1.010]) and in hot temperatures in the seven lag days (RR, 1.14; 95% CI [1.09-1.17]). The significant dose-response relationship of latitude and longitude in cold exposure with cardiovascular mortality was found. The results showed that the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased with each degree increased significantly in latitude and longitude in cold exposure (0.2%, 95% CI [0.006-0.035]) and (0.07%, 95% CI [0.0003-0.014]) respectively. The risk of cardiovascular mortality increased with each degree increase in latitude in heat exposure (0.07%, 95% CI [0.0008-0.124]). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the increase and decrease in ambient temperature had a relationship with the cardiovascular mortality. To prevent the temperature- related mortality, persons with cardiovascular disease and the elderly should be targeted.

In this study, we investigate the short-term effect of ambient temperature on admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Tehran, Iran. We used a case-crossover design combined with a distributed lag non-linear model to examine nonlinear and delayed associations between ambient temperature and AMI admissions from 2013 to 2016. We also examined hot and cold effects on AMI admission by gender and age categories (<=65 years old and >65 years old). Both hot and cold temperatures increased the risk of AMI admissions. Effects of high temperature appeared immediately on the current day and lasted for 3 days, whereas cold effects became apparent after 2 days and persisted for about 8 days. The early acute increase in risk associated with high temperature was followed by a deficit, thus suggesting evidence of a harvesting effect. In additions, males and those aged <=65 years old were more vulnerable to high temperatures.","Mohammadi, Rasool     Soori, Hamid     Alipour, Abbas     Bitaraf, Ehsan     Khodakarim, Soheila     eng     England     2018/03/20     J Therm Biol. 2018 Apr;73:24-31. doi: 10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.02.008.

These risk factors may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: We estimated AKI cumulative incidence in a convenience sample of 283 agricultural workers based on elevations of serum creatinine between preshift and postshift blood samples. Heat strain was assessed based on changes in core body temperature and heart rate. Volume depletion was assessed using changes in body mass over the work shift. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations of AKI with traditional risk factors (age, diabetes, hypertension and history of kidney disease) as well as with occupational risk factors (years in farm work, method of payment and farm task). RESULTS: 35 participants were characterised with incident AKI over the course of a work shift (12.3%). Workers who experienced heat strain had increased adjusted odds of AKI (1.34, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.74). Piece rate work was associated with 4.24 odds of AKI (95% CI 1.56 to 11.52). Females paid by the piece had 102.81 adjusted odds of AKI (95% CI 7.32 to 1443.20). DISCUSSION: Heat strain and piece rate work are associated with incident AKI after a single shift of agricultural work, though gender differences exist.

Conclusive evidence is lacking on whether long-term changes of this sensitivity can be attributed to specific adaptation measures, such as air conditioning, or should be linked to societal adaptation, such as improved healthcare systems or socioeconomic well-being. The aim of this study was to assess the variation of the association between heat and daily mortality during summer in Japan since the 1970s and to examine the influence of air conditioning (AC) prevalence, healthcare resources, and socioeconomic developments at the prefecture level on this variation. We analyzed daily total, cardiovascular and respiratory disease mortality and temperature data from 1972 to 2010 for 47 prefectures. We used Poisson generalized linear model to estimate the effect of heat on mortality, random effects model to obtain the mean national effect estimates, and meta-regression to explore the impact of prefecture-level characteristics. Average summer temperature has increased across Japan during the 39-year period. Excess mortality attributable to summer heat has decreased, with a national reduction of 20 (95%CI: 17, 22), 21 (95%CI: 18, 25), and 46 (95%CI: 36, 55) cases of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths (per 1000 deaths). The increase of AC prevalence was not associated with a reduction of excess mortality over time. Prefectures and populations with improved economic status documented a larger decline of excess mortality. Healthcare resources were associated with fewer heat-related deaths in the 1970s, but the associations did not persist in the more recent period (i.e., 2006-2010). Excess mortality due to heat has reduced in Japan, suggesting population adaptation. Yet, heat remains a significant health risk. Socioeconomic developments may play a role in heat adaptation. These findings may have implications for ensuring effective prevention of heat-related health impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The seasonal variation of OHCA has been observed, but the potential effects of ambient temperature on OHCA were rarely investigated. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the association between ambient temperature and OHCA in Guangzhou, China. We collected daily emergency ambulance dispatches for OHCA from the Guangzhou Emergency Center from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012. We analyzed the associations using the time-series method. We applied the generalized linear model combined with the distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the potentially non-linear and lagged effects of temperature on OHCA. Time trends, day of the week, and air pollutants were controlled as covariates. We identified a total of 4369 cases of OHCD. The associations between daily mean temperature and OHCA were generally J-shaped. Both low and high temperatures could increase the risk of OHCA. The effects were strongest on the concurrent day (lag 0) and lasted for 6 or 7 days. The cumulative risks of extreme cold (1st percentile of temperature) and extreme heat (99th percentile of temperature) over lags 0-21 days were 3.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63, 8.63) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.15, 5.33), respectively, compared with the referent temperature (28 degrees C). This study suggested that both cold and hot temperatures could significantly increase the risk of OHCA in Guangzhou, China.

India, an understudied area with > 15% of the world's population, commonly experiences temperature extremes and already resembles potential future climates of more temperate regions. Registry data from local municipal corporations and government offices were collected and translated, yielding daily all-cause mortality for 4 communities in Northwest India for all or part of the period 2000-2012. Heat waves were defined as >= 2 days with local temperature >= 97th percentile for that community. An alternate definition matching that used by the Indian Meteorological Department was also developed, to enhance policy relevance. Community-specific average daily maximum temperature over the entire record ranged from 32.5 to 34.2 degrees C (90.5-93.6 degrees F). Across communities, total mortality increased 18.1% during heat wave days compared with non-heat-wave days [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3%, 47.3%], with the highest risk in Jaipur (29.9% [95% CI: 24.6%, 34.9%]). Evidence of effect modification by heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in season) was limited. Findings indicate health risks associated with heat waves in communities with high baseline temperatures. Results can inform heat wave-health assessments in temperate regions in future, and improve our understanding of temperature-health associations under climate change. Further investigation of potential effect modification by heat wave characteristics is needed.","Nori-Sarma, Amruta     Anderson, G Brooke     Rajiva, Ajit     ShahAzhar, Gulrez     Gupta, Prakash     Pednekar, Mangesh S     Son, Ji-Young     Peng, Roger D     Bell, Michelle L     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

However, the association between elevated ambient temperature and specific mental health conditions remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between ambient heat and mental health-related emergency department (ED) visits in the contiguous US among adults overall and among potentially sensitive subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-crossover study used medical claims data obtained from OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) to identify claims for ED visits with a primary or secondary discharge psychiatric diagnosis during warm-season months (May to September) from 2010 through 2019. Claims for adults aged 18 years or older with commercial or Medicare Advantage health insurance who were living in 2775 US counties were included in the analysis. Emergency department visits were excluded if the Clinical Classifications Software code indicated that the visits were for screening for mental health outcomes and impulse control disorders. EXPOSURES: County-specific daily maximum ambient temperature on a continuous scale was estimated using the Parameter-Elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes model. Extreme heat was defined as the 95th percentile of the county-specific warm-season temperature distribution. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The daily incidence rate of cause-specific mental health diagnoses and a composite end point of any mental health diagnosis were assessed by identifying ED visit claims using primary and secondary discharge diagnosis International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CIs for the association between daily temperature and incidence rates of ED visits. RESULTS: Data from 3496762 ED visits among 2243395 unique individuals were identified (56.8% [1 274 456] women; mean [SD] age, 51.0 [18.8] years); of these individuals, 14.3% were aged 18 to 26 years, 25.6% were aged 27 to 44 years, 33.3% were aged 45 to 64 years, and 26.8% were aged 65 years or older. Days of extreme heat were associated with an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI, 1.07-1.09) for ED visits for any mental health condition. Associations between extreme heat and ED visits were found for specific mental health conditions, including substance use disorders (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07-1.10); anxiety, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09); mood disorders (IRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09); schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07); self-harm (IRR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12); and childhood-onset behavioral disorders (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). In addition, associations were higher among men (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12) and in the US Northeast (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13), Midwest (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.13), and Northwest (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21) regions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-crossover study of a large population of US adults with health insurance, days of extreme heat were associated with higher rates of mental health-related ED visits. This finding may be informative for clinicians providing mental health services during periods of extreme heat to prepare for increases in health service needs when times of extreme heat are anticipated.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Ashwin,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.4369,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Cross-Over Studies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;*Hot Temperature;Humans;Male;Medicare;*Mental Health;Middle Aged;United States/ep [Epidemiology];Young Adult;Hot Temperature;Emergencies",,

Rather than ambient temperature, we used a human thermophysiological index, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) to investigate the role of long-term heat stress exposure on stillbirth in Ghana. Methods: District-level monthly UTCI was linked with 90,532 stillbirths of 5,961,328 births across all 260 local districts between 1st January 2012 and 31st December 2020. A within-space time-series design was applied with distributed lag nonlinear models and conditional quasi-Poisson regression. Results: The mean (28.5 ± 2.1 °C) and median UTCI (28.8 °C) indicated moderate heat stress. The Relative Risks (RRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for exposure to lower-moderate heat (1st to 25th percentiles of UTCI) and strong heat (99th percentile) stresses showed lower risks, relative to the median UTCI. The higher-moderate heat stress exposures (75th and 90th percentiles) showed greater risks which increased with the duration of heat stress exposures and were stronger in the 90th percentile. The risk ranged from 2% (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.99, 1.05) to 18% (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.02, 1.36) for the 90th percentile, relative to the median UTCI. Assuming causality, 19 (95% CI 3, 37) and 27 (95% CI 3, 54) excess stillbirths per 10,000 births were attributable to long-term exposure to the 90th percentile relative to median UTCI for the past six and nine months, respectively. Districts with low population density, low gross domestic product, and low air pollution which collectively defined rural districts were at higher risk as compared to those in the high level (urban districts). Discussion: Maternal exposure to long-term heat stress was associated with a greater risk of stillbirth. Climate change-resilient interventional measures to reduce maternal exposure to heat stress, particularly in rural areas may help lower the risk of stillbirth. © 2023 The Authors","Nyadanu, Sylvester Dodzi     Tessema, Gizachew A     Mullins, Ben     Kumi-Boateng, Bernard     Ofosu, Anthony Adofo     Pereira, Gavin     eng     Netherlands     2023/02/04     Environ Res. 2023 Apr 1;222:115385. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2023.115385.

Objectives: To investigate the acute effect of maternal exposure to thermophysiological stress (measured with Universal Thermal Climate Index, UTCI) on the risk of stillbirth and modification of this effect by sociodemographic disparities. Methods: We conducted a space-time-stratified case-crossover analysis of daily UTCI and 2835 singleton stillbirths between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2015 across multiple small areas in Western Australia. Distributed lag nonlinear models were combined with conditional quasi-Poisson regression to investigate the effects of the UTCI exposure from the preceding 6 days to the day of stillbirth. We also explored effect modification by fetal and maternal sociodemographic factors. Results: The median UTCI was 13.9 degrees C (representing no thermal stress) while the 1st and 99th percentiles were 0.7 degrees C (slight cold stress) and 31.7 degrees C (moderate heat stress), respectively. Relative to median UTCI, we found positive associations between acute maternal cold and heat stresses and higher risks of stillbirth, increasing with the intensity and duration of the thermal stress episodes. The cumulative risk from the preceding 6 days to the day of stillbirth was stronger in the 99th percentile (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.21) than the 1st percentile (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.12,1.15), relative to the median UTCI. The risks were disproportionately higher in term and male stillborn fetuses, smoking, unmarried, <= 19 years old, non-Caucasian, and low socioeconomic status mothers. Discussion: Acute maternal exposure to both cold and heat stresses may contribute to the risk of stillbirth and be exacerbated by sociodemographic disparities. The findings suggest public health attention, especially for the identified higher-risk groups. Future studies should consider the use of a human thermophysiological index, rather than surrogates such as ambient temperature.","Nyadanu, Sylvester Dodzi     Tessema, Gizachew Assefa     Mullins, Ben     Pereira, Gavin     eng     Netherlands     2022/05/09     Sci Total Environ. 2022 Aug 25;836:155750. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155750.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of acute kidney injury over the course of the work shift and the association with heat stress among agricultural workers in Spain, where summer temperatures are high and heatwaves are expected to be frequent. METHODS: Male agricultural workers were enrolled in two different harvesting seasons and provinces, as follows: summer in Alacant (n=43; September, 2018) and winter in Tarragona (n=52; November, 2018, and January, 2019). For each participant, we estimated exposure to heat stress during a work shift based on the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index and acute kidney injury cross-shift incidence, defined as an increase in post-shift serum creatinine by at least 0·3 mg/dL or at least 1·5 times the pre-shift serum creatinine concentration. We collected information on confounders. For a subsample of participants (n=54), we measured neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations before and after the working shift. We used regression models to assess if heat stress was a risk factor for acute kidney injury and increase in NGAL concentrations. FINDINGS: The mean WBGT was 24·5°C (SD 2·0; range 20·2-27·1) during the summer season and 14·2°C (8·0-20·7) during the winter season. Nine (21%) of 43 workers harvesting during summer were exposed to heat stress. Incidence of acute kidney injury was higher during the summer season (14 [33%] of 43 workers vs two [4%] of 52 workers). Heat stress was associated with cross-shift incidence of acute kidney injury (age-adjusted odds ratio 9·6, 95% CI 1·4-67·9). No differences in NGAL concentrations were observed between participants exposed to heat stress. INTERPRETATION: Heat stress is a risk factor for acute kidney injury among agricultural workers in Spain, even when environmental temperatures are not extreme. Monitoring acute kidney injury incidence among agricultural workers in Spain is important in the context of climate change, as frequent episodes of acute kidney injury can lead to chronic kidney disease.

City-specific Poisson regression analyses of daily noninjury mortality were fit with predictors of mean daily apparent temperature (a construct reflecting physiologic effects of temperature and humidity), time, barometric pressure, day of the week, and particulate matter less than 10 micro m in aerodynamic diameter. Percentage change in mortality was calculated at 29 degrees C apparent temperature (lag 0) and at -5 degrees C (mean of lags 1, 2, and 3) relative to 15 degrees C. Separate models were fit to death counts stratified by age, race, gender, education, and place of death. Effect estimates were combined across cities, treating city as a random effect. Deaths among Blacks compared with Whites, deaths among the less educated, and deaths outside a hospital were more strongly associated with hot and cold temperatures, but gender made no difference. Stronger cold associations were found for those less than age 65 years, but heat effects did not vary by age. The strongest effect modifier was place of death for heat, with out-of-hospital effects more than five times greater than in-hospital deaths, supporting the biologic plausibility of the associations.

We determined the association between EH and hospitalizations for all natural causes; cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases; diabetes mellitus; and acute myocardial infarction in Michigan, USA, at different intensities and durations. We assessed confounding by ozone and how individual characteristics and health insurance payer (a proxy for income) modified these associations. We obtained Michigan Inpatient Database, National Climatic Data Center, and US Environmental Protection Agency ozone data for May-September, 2000-2009 for three Michigan counties. We employed a case-crossover design and modeled EH as an indicator for temperature above the 95th, 97th, or 99th percentile thresholds for 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. We examined effect modification by patient age, race, sex, and health insurance payer and pooled the county results. Among non-whites, the pooled odds ratio for hospitalization on EH (97th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH days for renal diseases was 1.37 (95 % CI = 1.13-1.66), which increased with increasing EH intensity, but was null among whites (OR = 1.00, 95 % CI = 0.81, 1.25). We observed a null association between EH and cardiovascular hospitalization. EH (99th percentile threshold) was associated with myocardial infarction hospitalizations. Confounding by ozone was minimal. EH was associated with hospitalizations for renal disease among non-whites.

The reactivation of thermoregulatory mechanisms is usually accompanied by the excitation of cardiovascular responses. This paper presents a combined thermoregulatory-cardiovascular model for predicting the effect of transient thermal environments on heart rate and cardiovascular responses. The proposed model was validated against multiple sets of experimental data reported in the literature. The validation results showed that the proposed model, which considers the thermoregulatory effects, could predict heart rate more accurately compared to the Givoni and Goldman practical model. The impacts of different up-step temperature changes on cardiovascular responses were investigated using the proposed model. The results showed that exposure to a relatively small (10?), medium (20?), and large (30?) up-step temperature changes increased the heart rate by about 7%, 20%, and 35%, respectively. It was also found that ambient relative humidity did not have remarkable effects on cardiovascular responses. The results of our analysis performed in the temperature range of 20? to 50? showed that the heart rate could reflect the reactivation of the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms. The findings indicated that in people with artificial heart valves, sudden exposure to temperature step changes of 10? to 30? could increase the heart valve pressure drop by about 14%-85%, greatly increasing the risk of blood damage. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposed model can pave the path for utilizing integrated wearable devices for predicting individualized thermal comfort and managing cardiovascular health risks associated with ambient heat stresses.",0k7jg     Times Cited:4     Cited References Count:59 | RAYYAN-LABELS: new,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108852,Heart rate;Heat exposure;Step-change;Thermoregulatory;Transient;thermal environment;SKIN TEMPERATURE;COMFORT;BODY;PERCEPTION;BILEAFLET;RATES;MODEL,,

The impact of warmer ambient temperature has not been formally assessed previously. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether DIOS and constipation were related to warmer temperatures and seasons of the year. As a secondary aim, the differences in phenotype and genotype characteristics of patients with CF with complete DIOS, incomplete DIOS and constipation were evaluated. Methods: Hospitalizations for DIOS (incomplete or complete) and/or constipation were retrospectively identified (2000-2012) in Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick, Australia. Ambient temperature (for the day, week preceeding and season of hospitalization), phenotype and genotype information were collected. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria for DIOS and constipation were used. Results: Twenty-seven DIOS episodes (59.3% incomplete; 40.7% complete) in 17 patients and 44 constipation admissions in 30 patients were identified. All DIOS and constipation patients were pancreatic insufficient. Meconium ileus (MI) was significantly more likely in DIOS than constipation (64.7% vs. 33.3%; P=0.038). In subgroup analysis, patients who developed complete DIOS were significantly more likely to had MI at birth compared to those with incomplete DIOS (100% vs. 57.1%; P=0.04). Males were also significantly more likely to present with complete DIOS (9/11; 81.8%) than incomplete DIOS (6/16; 37.5%) (P=0.04). There were no significant differences in weight z-scores, height z-scores, body mass index z-scores, FEV1 percent predicted, length of hospitalization, and CF-related diabetes between patients with DIOS and those with constipation. Both DIOS and constipation episodes were associated with significantly hotter peak temperatures in the week before presentation. The maximum temperature of the week (mean (SD) = 28.0 (5.8) oC) before DIOS admission was significantly higher than the maximum temperatures of the day (24.2 (6.2) oC; P=0.027) and season (25.2 (3.4) oC; P=0.04) of admission. There was no significant difference between the peak day and season temperatures. There were also no significant differences between the mean temperatures of the day, week and season. Similarly, the peak temperature of the week before hospitalisation for constipation (mean (SD) = 27.9 (6.3) oC) was also significantly warmer compared to the maximum temperatures of the day (21.7 (5.0) oC); P<0.0001) and season (24.0 (4.1) oC; P=0.0009) of admission. The maximum temperature of the season was also significantly higher than the maximum temperature of the day (P=0.018).

This study aims to explore temporal variations of the minimum mortality temperature and mortality burden from heat and cold between 1979 and 2018. METHODS: We collected individual all-cause mortality and climate reanalysis data for 4 decades at a daily time step. To estimate the temperature-mortality association for each decade, we fitted a quasi-Poisson time-series regression model using a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, controlling for trends and day of the week. We also calculated attributable mortality fractions by age and sex for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponds to the minimum mortality in each period. RESULTS: We analysed over 14 million deaths registered in Spain between 1979 and 2018. The optimum temperature estimated at a nationwide scale declined from 21 degreeC in 1979-1988 to 16 degreeC in 1999-2008, and raised to 18 degreeC in 2009-2018. The mortality burden from moderate cold showed a 3-fold reduction down to 2.4% in 2009-2018. Since 1988-1999, the mortality risk attributable to moderate (extreme) heat reduced from 0.9% (0.8%) to 0.6% (0.5%). The mortality risk due to heat in women was almost 2 times larger than in men, and did not decrease over time. CONCLUSION: Despite the progressively warmer temperatures in Spain, we observed a persistent flattening of the exposure-response curves, which marked an expansion of the uncertainty range of the optimal temperatures. Adaptation has been produced to some extent in a non-uniform manner with a substantial decrease in cold-related mortality, while for heat it became more apparent in the most recent decade only.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Ashwin,10.1186/s12940-022-00957-6,Male;Humans;Female;Temperature;Spain/ep [Epidemiology];Risk Factors;*Cold Temperature;*Hot Temperature;Mortality;Spain,,

Heat waves have adverse health effects, especially for the elderly, since chronic diseases are more frequent in that group than in the population overall. The aim of the study was to investigate mortality during heat waves in an adult population aged 50 years or over, as well as in susceptible subgroups of that population in Rome and Stockholm during the summer periods from 2000 to 2008. METHODS: We collected daily number of deaths occurring between 15th May and 15th September each year for the population above 50 as well as the susceptible subgroups. Heat wave days were defined as two or more days exceeding the city specific 95th percentile of maximum apparent temperature (MAT). The relationship between heat waves and all-cause non-accidental mortality was investigated through time series modelling, adjusting for time trends. RESULTS: The percent increase in daily mortality during heat waves as compared to normal summer days was, in the 50+ population, 22% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 18-26%) in Rome and 8% (95% CI: 3-12%) in Stockholm.

METHODS: We collected time-series data on SCZ hospitalisations for 10 years (2005-2014), with a total of 36 607 cases registered. We used quasi-Poisson regression and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to assess the association between extreme temperature (cold and heat) and SCZ hospitalisations. A time-varying DLNM was then used to explore the temporal trends of the association between extreme temperature and SCZ hospitalisations in different periods. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (0-39 and 40+ years) and gender, respectively. RESULTS: We found that extreme cold and heat significantly increased the risk of SCZ hospitalisations (cold: 1st percentile of temperature 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.37) and 2.5th percentile of temperature 1.16 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.31); heat: 97.5th percentile of temperature 1.37 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.66) and 99th percentile of temperature 1.38 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.69)). We found a slightly decreasing trend in heat-related SCZ hospitalisations and a sharp increasing trend in cold effects from 2005 to 2014. However, the risk of heat-related hospitalisation has been rising since 2008. Stratified analyses showed that age and gender had different modification effects on temporal trends. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight that as temperatures rise the body's adaptability to high temperatures may be accompanied by more threats from extreme cold. The burden of cold-related SCZ hospitalisations may increase in the future.","Pan, Rubing     Wang, Qizhi     Yi, Weizhuo     Wei, Qiannan     Cheng, Jian     Su, Hong     eng     England     2021/03/20     Occup Environ Med. 2021 Mar 18:oemed-2020-107181. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2020-107181. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",10.1136/oemed-2020-107181,Schizophrenia;China,,

However, to date, existing AF evidence is scarce for the relationship between temperature and the hospitalizations for SCZ. Objectives: Our primary goal is to estimate the attributable burden of hospitalizations for SCZ related to cold and heat, respectively. Furthermore, to identify vulnerable populations due to heat and cold. Methods: Poisson generalized linear models combined with DLNMs were used to estimate the association between hospitalizations for SCZ and temperature from 2005 to 2014. The minimum risk temperature (MRT) was used as a reference, to calculate the burden of disease caused by cold and heat. Results: We found that the majority hospitalizations attributed to heat (70.9%). In different individual levels, men are more sensitive to heat exposure while women are more vulnerable to cold. Among different age groups, the results showed that the attributable risk was slightly higher in the over-40s than in the under-40s. Besides, under different marital conditions, it showed that the unmarried had a little higher attributional risk than the married. Conclusions: We should pay attention to the impact of heat on hospitalizations for SCZ, especially in those over 40 years old, men and non-married. Our research will provide a basis for policymakers to develop intervention strategies to minimize the impact of adverse temperatures on hospitalizations for SCZ, thereby reducing the burden of disease.

RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2010, 3.9% [CI 95% 3.2:4.6] of the total mortality was attributed to cold, and 1.2% [1.1:1.2] to heat. The immediate increase in mortality following high temperatures was partly compensated by a harvesting effect when temperatures were below the 99.2 percentiles of the mean temperature distributions. DISCUSSION: Cold represents a significant public health burden, mostly driven by moderate temperatures (between percentiles 2.5 and 25). The population is better adapted to warm temperatures, up to a certain intensity when heat becomes an acute environmental health emergency (above percentile 99). The rapid increase in mortality risk at very high temperatures percentiles calls for an active adaptation in a context of climate change.","Pascal, Mathilde     Wagner, Verene     Corso, Magali     Laaidi, Karine     Ung, Aymeric     Beaudeau, Pascal     eng     Netherlands     2018/09/15     Environ Int. 2018 Dec;121(Pt 1):189-198. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.049.

Mortality rates from CKDu appear to have increased dramatically since the 1970s. To explore this relationship, we assessed trends in maximum and minimum temperatures during harvest months between 1973 and 2014 as well as in the number of days during the harvest season for which the maximum temperature surpassed 35 degreeC. Data were collected at a weather station at a Nicaraguan sugar company where large numbers of workers have been affected by CKDu. Monthly averages of the daily maximum temperatures between 1996 and 2014 were also compared to concurrent weather data from eight Automated Surface Observing System Network weather stations across Nicaragua. Our objectives were to assess changes in temperature across harvest seasons, estimate the number of days that workers were at risk of heat-related illness and compare daily maximum temperatures across various sites in Nicaragua. The monthly average daily maximum temperature during the harvest season increased by 0.7 degreeC per decade between 1973 and 1990. The number of days per harvest season with a maximum temperature over 35 degreeC increased by approximately five days per year between 1974 and 1990, from 32 days to 114 days. Between 1991 and 2013, the number of harvest days with a maximum temperature over 35 degreeC decreased by two days per year, and the monthly average daily maximum temperature decreased by 0.3 degreeC per decade.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between heatwaves and hospitalization and the potential influence of socio-economic factors on this relationship in Vietnam. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with Poisson family and Distributed Lag Models (DLM) were applied to evaluate the effect of heatwaves for each province (province-level effect). A random-effects meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled estimates (country-level effects) for 'all causes', infectious, cardiovascular, and respiratory admissions queried by lag days, regions, sex, and ages. We used random-effects meta-regression to explore the potential influence of socio-economic factors on the relationship between heatwaves and hospitalization. The size of province-level effects varied across provinces. The pooled estimates show that heatwaves were significantly associated with a 2.5% (95%CI: 0.8-4.3) and 3.8% (95%CI, 1.5-6.2) increase in all causes and infectious admissions at lag 0. Cardiovascular and respiratory admissions (0.8%, 95%CI: -1.6-3.3; 2.2%, 95%CI: -0.7-5.2) were not significantly increased after a heatwave event.

However there have been hardly any studies on temperature-hospitalization relationships. The objectives of this study were to examine temperature-hospitalization relationship and to evaluate the effects of socio-economic factors on the risk of hospitalizations due to high temperature in the MDR. The Generalized Linear and Distributed Lag Models were used to examine hospitalizations for extreme temperature for each of the 13 provinces in the MDR. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled risk for all causes, and for infectious, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases sorted by sex and age groups. Random-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate the effect of socio-economic factors on the temperature-hospitalization association. For 1degreeC increase in average temperature, the risk of hospital admissions increased by 1.3% (95% CI, 0.9-1.8) for all causes, 2.2% (95% CI, 1.4-3.1) for infectious diseases, and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.5-1.7) for respiratory diseases. However the result was inconsistent for cardiovascular diseases. Meta-regression showed population density, poverty rate, and illiteracy rate increased the risk of hospitalization due to high temperature, while higher household income, houses using safe water, and houses using hygienic toilets reduced this risk. In the MDR, high temperatures have a significant impact on hospitalizations for infectious and respiratory diseases. Our findings have important implications for better understanding the future impacts of climate change on residents of the MDR.

Thermal stress is determined by air temperature in combination with other meteorological parameters, such as relative humidity and wind speed. The present study is focused on the Mediterranean city of Thessaloniki, Greece and it aims to explore the association between thermal stress and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, using both air temperature and other thermal indices as indicators. For that, an over-dispersed Poisson regression function was used, in combination with distributed lag non-linear models, in order to capture the delayed and nonlinear effects of temperature. Our results revealed a reverse J-shaped exposure-response curve for the total population and females and a U-shaped association for males. In all cases examined, the minimum mortality temperature was identified around the 80th percentile of each distribution. It is noteworthy that despite the fact that the highest risks of cardiovascular mortality were estimated for exposure to extreme temperatures, moderate temperatures were found to cause the highest burden of mortality.

We applied conditional quasi-Poisson regression models with non-linear distributed lag functions to estimate temperature-mortality associations over all cities (1995-2013) and separately for two time periods (1995-2002, 2004-2013). Relative risks (RR) of daily mortality were estimated for increases in temperature from the median to the 98th percentile of the warm season temperature distribution. Over the whole time period, significant temperature-mortality relationships were found for all temperature indicators (RR (95% confidence interval): Tappmax: 1.12 (1.05; 1.18); Tmax: 1.15 (1.08-1.22); Tmean: 1.16 (1.09-1.23); Tmin 1.23 (1.15-1.32)). Mortality risks were higher at the beginning of the summer, especially for Tmin. In the more recent time period, we observed a non-significant reduction in the effect of high temperatures on mortality, with the age group > 74 years remaining the population at highest risk. High temperatures continue to be a considerable risk factor for human health in Switzerland after 2003. More effective public health measures targeting the elderly should be promoted with increased attention to the first heat events in summer and considering both high day-time and night-time temperatures.","Ragettli, Martina S     Vicedo-Cabrera, Ana M     Schindler, Christian     Roosli, Martin     eng     Netherlands     2017/07/25     Environ Res. 2017 Oct;158:703-709. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.021.

METHODS: In this time-series study, the effect of O<sub>3</sub> (ppb), CO (ppm), NO<sub>2</sub> (ppb), SO<sub>2</sub> (ppb), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (mug/m<sup>3</sup>), and minimum, maximum, and mean daily temperature (degreeC) on stillbirth was evaluated in Tehran, Iran between March 2015 and March 2018. Using a quasi-Poisson regression model in combination with a Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM), the Relative Risk (RR) was estimated through comparing the high temperature (99th, 95th, and 75th percentiles) and low temperature (1st, 5th, and 25th percentiles) with the median. The effect of air pollution was estimated for each 1-, 5-, or 10-unit increase in the concentration during lags (days) 0-21. RESULTS: Among air pollutants, only a 5-ppm increase in the SO<sub>2</sub> concentration in lag 0 increased the risk of stillbirth significantly (RR = 1.062; 1.002-1.125). The largest effect of heat was observed while comparing the 99th percentile of minimum daily temperature (26.9 degreeC) with the median temperature (13.2 degreeC), which was not statistically significant (RR = 1.25; 0.95-1.65). As for cold, a non-significant protective effect was observed while comparing the 1st percentile of maximum daily temperature (3.1 degreeC) with the median temperature (23.2 degreeC) (RR = 0.92; 0.72-1.19). CONCLUSION: Each 5-ppm increase in the mean daily SO<sub>2</sub> in lag 0 increased the risk of stillbirth by 6% while other air pollutants had no significant effects on stillbirth. In lags 0 and 1, the heat increased the risk of stillbirth while the cold had protective effects, which were not statistically significant.","Ranjbaran, Mehdi     Mohammadi, Rasool     Yaseri, Mehdi     Kamari, Mehdi     Habibelahi, Abbas     Yazdani, Kamran     eng     England     2020/12/15     J Environ Health Sci Eng. 2020 Oct 1;18(2):1289-1299. doi: 10.1007/s40201-020-00547-z. eCollection 2020 Dec. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",10.1007/s40201-020-00547-z,Air pollution;Ambient temperature;Distributed lag non-linear models;Stillbirth,,

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether areas with higher heat vulnerability, as characterized by the HVI, experienced higher rates of morbidity and mortality on abnormally hot days. METHODS: We used Poisson regression to model the interaction of HVI and deviant days (days whose deviation of maximum temperature from the 30-year normal maximum temperature is at or above the 95th percentile) on hospitalization and mortality counts in five states participating in the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network for the years 2000 through 2007. RESULTS: The HVI was associated with higher hospitalization and mortality rates in all states on both normal days and deviant days. However, associations were significantly stronger (interaction p-value < 0.05) on deviant days for heat-related illness, acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis in California, heat-related illness in Washington, all-cause mortality in New Mexico, and respiratory hospitalizations in Massachusetts.

To date, no studies were performed in South America, a region with serious challenges related to climate change. Our investigation addresses this literature lack by examining the association between Low Birth Weight (LBW) and ambient temperature exposure in the largest county in South America, Brazil. We applied a nationwide case-control study design using a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for LBW associated with ambient temperature during a specific trimester of pregnancy (1-3 trimester). Our sample size includes 5,790,713 birth records nationwide over 18 years (2001-2018), of which 264,967 infants were included in the model as cases of LBW, representing 4.6% of our total sample. We adjusted our model for several confounding variables, including weather factors, air pollution, seasonality, and SES variables at the individual level. Our findings indicate that North was the only region with positive and statistically significant associations in the primary analysis and most of the sensitivity analysis, which is the region where the Amazon is located. In this region, we estimated an increase of 5.16% (95%CI: 3.60; 6.74) in the odds of LBW per 1 degreeC increase in apparent temperature when the exposure occurred in the second trimester. Our results may be explained by the climate conditions in the Amazon region in the past years. A large body of literature indicates that the Amazon region has been facing serious climate challenges including issues related to policy, governance, and deforestation. Specifically, regarding deforestation, it is suggested that land use change and deforestation is projected to increase heat stress in the Amazon region, because of Amazon savannization, increasing the risk of heat stress exposure in Northern Brazil. Our study can assist public sectors and clinicians in mitigating the risk and vulnerability of the Amazonian population.","Requia, Weeberb J     Koutrakis, Petros     Papatheodorou, Stefania     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2022/07/22     Environ Res. 2022 Nov;214(Pt 2):113923. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.113923.

Many studies show higher mortality rates during heat waves, with mortality increasing with heat wave duration. However, such effects have not been explicitly incorporated in models of temperature and mortality; while from a physiological basis, dehydration followed by cardiovascular stress is more likely to occur in such conditions. Methods: We established time-series Poisson regression models based on cause-specific mortality and age stratified mortality in Stockholm County, 1990-2002, adjusting for time trends and potential confounders. We studied the effects estimates as functions of time within summers and winters. Results: Warmer temperatures increase all natural causes of death, while decreasing colder temperatures increases the risk of cardiovascular deaths. Moreover, persistent extreme heat exposure is associated substantially with additional deaths, and the risk of death increase significantly with longer heat exposure. Extreme exposure to heat is associated with higher death rates in people with lower age, compared to a rise in temperature. Furthermore, the impact of warm and cold temperatures decreases within the season, while the impact of persistent extreme heat exposure remains similar throughout the summer. Conclusion: This study is the first to show that additional impacts of persistence of extreme heat exposure are important to account for in models of mortality related to ambient temperatures to avoid negatively biased estimates of the associated effects. Moreover, it appears that the impacts of temperature depend on the size of the pool of fragile individuals, while persistent extreme heat exposure increases the influx of new individuals to the pool and, thus, remain large throughout the season.","Rocklov, Joacim     Ebi, Kristie     Forsberg, Bertil     eng     England     2010/10/22     Occup Environ Med. 2011 Jul;68(7):531-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.2010.058818.

In areas that today have mild climates the research activity has been rather limited, despite the fact that differences in temperature susceptibility will play a fundamental role in understanding the exposure, acclimatization, adaptation and health risks of a changing climate. In addition, many studies employ biometeorological indexes without careful investigation of the regional heterogeneity in the impact of relative humidity. We aimed to investigate the effects of summer temperature and relative humidity and regional differences in three regions of Sweden allowing for heterogeneity of the effect over the scale of summer temperature. To do so, we collected mortality data for ages 65+ from Stockholm, Goteborg and Skane from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for the years 1998 through 2005. In Stockholm and Skane on average 22 deaths per day occurred, while in Goteborg the mean frequency of daily deaths was 10. We fitted time-series regression models to estimate relative risks of high ambient temperatures on daily mortality using smooth functions to control for confounders, and estimated non-linear effects of exposure while allowing for auto-regressive correlation of observations within summers. The effect of temperature on mortality was found distributed over the same or following day, with statistically significant cumulative combined relative risk of about 5.1% (CI = 0.3, 10.1) per degrees C above the 90th percentile of summer temperature. The effect of high relative humidity was statistically significant in only one of the regions, as was the effect of relative humidity (above 80th percentile) and temperature (above 90th percentile). In the southernmost region studied there appeared to be a significant increase in mortality with decreasing low summer temperatures that was not apparent in the two more northerly situated regions. The effects of warm temperatures on the elderly population in Sweden are rather strong and consistent across different regions after adjustment for mortality displacement. The impact of relative humidity appears to be different in regions, and may be a more important predictor of mortality in some areas.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.3390/ijerph7062607,"Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;*Cause of Death/td [Trends];Confidence Intervals;Female;Geography;*Health Status;*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Humidity;Male;Models, Statistical;*Mortality/td [Trends];Poisson Distribution;*Public Health/td [Trends];Risk;Risk Factors;Statistics as Topic;Sweden;*Temperature;Temperature",,

In Greater London itself, where daytime temperatures were higher (and with lesser falls at night), mortality increased by 16.1% during the heatwave. Using the same risk coefficients to estimate the excess mortality apparently attributable to air pollution, more than 60% of the total excess in London was apparently attributable to the effects of heat.

This study assesses the effects of heat wave intensity on mortality (natural, respiratory and cardiovascular causes) in four of the largest cities of Spain (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid and Seville) during the period between 1990 and 2014. To model the heat wave severity the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) was used. The EHF is a two-component index. The first is the comparison of the three-day average daily mean temperature with the 95th percentile. The second component is a measure of the temperatures reached during the three-day period compared with the recent past (the previous 30 days). The city-specific exposure-response curves showed a non-linear J-shaped relationship between mortality and the EHF. Overall city-specific mortality risk estimates in natural causes for 1st vs. 99th percentile increases range from the highest mortality risk with 2.73 (95% CI: 2.34-3.18) in Seville to a risk of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.62-1.97) and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.45-2.19) in Barcelona and Bilbao, respectively. When we compare our results with risk estimates for the analyzed Spanish cities in other studies, the heat wave related mortality risks seem to be clearly higher. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different heat wave days of the same event do not present the same degree of severity/intensity. Thus, the intensity of a heat wave is an important mortality risk indicator during heat wave days. Due to the low number of studies on the EHF as a heat wave intensity indicator and heat-related mortality and morbidity, further research is required to validate its application in other geographic areas and focus populations.","Roye, Dominic     Codesido, Raquel     Tobias, Aurelio     Taracido, Margarita     eng     Netherlands     2019/12/31     Environ Res. 2020 Mar;182:109027. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2019.109027.

Emergency department (ED) experiences increased patients' flow and decreased survival as a consequence of heat stroke during the episodes of heat wave. The present study was conducted to identify the risk factors for mortality among victims of heat wave (17th - 23rd June), 2015 evaluated in the Emergency Department of The Indus Hospital (TIH), Karachi. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study data was retrospectively collected. Out of 2278 patients, 150 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria (core body temperature >38 degreeC, dehydrated and CNS dysfunction without infection) were included. Data was analysed using SPSS version 21 (IBM). RESULTS: Among 150 patients included for analysis, the mortality was observed in twenty-four patients (16%). Majority (64.7%) of the patients included in this retrospective study were males and older with median age of 51.5 years. It was identified that non-survivors had significantly lower diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation compared to survivors along with higher median reparatory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and length of stay in emergency, shock index, and proportion of unconscious level. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that heat stroke patients with decreased diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation as well as patients with increased shock index, low conscious level and higher core temperature, respiratory and pulse rate should be considered for more intensive management in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to decrease mortality rate during future heat stroke episodes.","Saleem, Syed Ghazanfar     Ansari, Tehreem     Ali, Ashraf Shamshad     Fatima, Sara     Rizvi, Mariam Hassan     Samad, Muhammad Abdul     eng     Pakistan     2017/07/19     J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2017 Apr-Jun;29(2):320-324. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",,Adult;Aged;Cause of Death/td [Trends];Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;*Fever/mo [Mortality];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Intensive Care Units;Male;Middle Aged;Pakistan/ep [Epidemiology];Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Survival Rate/td [Trends];Hot Temperature,,

We examined associations between the neighborhood Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) and recurrent hospitalizations among individuals with rheumatic conditions. METHODS: Using a Massachusetts multihospital centralized clinical data repository, we identified individuals >=18 years of age with a rheumatic condition who received rheumatology care within 3 years of April 2021. We defined the index date as 2 years before the last encounter and the baseline period as 1 year pre-index date. Addresses were geocoded and linked by census tract to the SVI and the HVI. We used multilevel, multinomial logistic regression to examine the odds of 1-3 and >=4 hospitalizations (reference = 0) over 2 years post index date by vulnerability index, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 14,401 individuals with rheumatic conditions, the mean +/- age was 61.9 +/- 15.7 years, 70% were female, 79% White, 7% Black, and 2% Hispanic.

Little is known, however, about cause-specific cardiovascular mortality, effect modification by air pollution and aircraft noise, and which population groups are the most vulnerable to extreme temperature. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study in Zurich, Switzerland, including all adult cardiovascular deaths between 2000 and 2015 with precise individual exposure estimates at home location. We estimated the risk of 24,884 cardiovascular deaths associated with heat and cold using distributed non-linear lag models. We investigated potential effect modification of temperature-related mortality by fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and night-time aircraft noise and performed stratified analyses across individual and social characteristics. We found increased risk of mortality for heat (odds ratio OR = 1.28 [95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.49] for 99th percentile of daily Tmean (24 degreeC) versus optimum temperature at 20 degreeC) and cold (OR = 1.15 [0.95-1.39], 5th percentile of daily Tmean (-3 degreeC) versus optimum temperature at 20 degreeC). Heat-related mortality was particularly strong for myocardial infarctions and hypertension related deaths, and among older women (>75 years). Analysis of effect modification also indicated that older women with lower socio-economic position and education are at higher risk for heat-related mortality. PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased the risk of heat-related mortality for heart failure, but not all-cause cardiovascular mortality.

Still, few have examined how temperature exposure in warm and cold seasons affect lung function and symptoms among community-dwelling COPD patients. Methodology: We included 30 Boston-based former smokers with COPD and GOLD Stage II or greater airflow obstruction. Personal ambient and outdoor temperature were measured using portable air quality monitors and stationary monitors, respectively. Participants were followed for up to 4 non-consecutive 30-day periods in different seasons over 12 months. Participants recorded daily morning lung function and reported any worsening respiratory symptoms compared to baseline by validated questionnaire. Symptoms were categorized as changes in breathing symptoms (breathlessness, chest tightness, wheeze) and in bronchitis symptoms (cough, sputum color or amount). We used linear multi-level and generalized mixed effects models to assess associations of daily personal and outdoor temperature (1- to 3-day moving averages) with lung function and symptoms, respectively, adjusting for humidity, age, sex, height, weight, smoking packyears, and education. We included random intercepts for person and person-observation month, with an autoregressive correlation structure, and repeated analyses stratified by warm and cold season. Results: We collected 3,500 observations among 30 participants. Participants were on average 71.1 years old (±8.4), 53.3% female, 80% white and 20% black, with 54.4 (±30.7) packyears of smoking. The median (interquartile range, IQR) of personal and outdoor temperature was 21.7 C (2.7) and 12.5C (15.9), respectively. Each 5 C higher personal temperature exposure was associated with a 1.9 (95%, CI 0.1-3.5, p=0.055) higher odds of worsening breathing symptoms, regardless of season. Higher outdoor temperature was associated with a 2.3 (95%, CI 1.4-3.9, p=0.001) higher odds of worsening breathing symptoms in the warm season only. Results were similar by 2- and 3-day moving averages. A 5 C lower outdoor temperature was associated with a 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.5, p=0.016) higher odds of worsening bronchitis symptoms, with similar associations for 2- and 3-day moving averages. We found no associations with lung function. Conclusions: In this COPD population, personal exposure to heat (regardless of season) and outdoor heat (during the warm season) was associated with worsening breathing symptoms, while outdoor cold was associated with bronchitis symptoms. These findings suggest an opportunity to address personal exposure to heat as a risk factor for aggravated dyspnea in COPD.",Suppl.

This study investigated socio-demographic characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions as effect modifiers of the risk of dying during heat waves in a cohort of elderly residents in Rome. METHODS: A cohort of 651,195 residents aged 65 yrs or older was followed from 2005 to 2007. During summer, heat wave days were defined according to month-specific thresholds of maximum apparent temperature. The adjusted relative risk of dying during heat waves was estimated using a Poisson regression model including all the considered covariates. Risk differences were also calculated. All analyses were run separately for the 65-74 and 75+ age groups. RESULTS: In the 65-74 age group the risk of dying during heat waves was higher among unmarried subjects and those with a previous hospitalization for chronic pulmonary disease or psychiatric disorders. In the 75+ age group, women, and unmarried subjects were more susceptible to heat. Furthermore, a higher susceptibility to heat among those with previous hospitalization for diabetes, diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), psychiatric disorders and cerebrovascular diseases resulted from risk differences. DISCUSSION: Results showed a higher susceptibility to heat among those older than seventy-five years, females and unmarried. Pre-existing health conditions play a different role among the two considered age groups. Moreover, compared with previous studies the pattern of susceptibility factors have slightly changed over time.

Children who are born prematurely have higher rates of cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illnesses and a higher susceptibility for many health conditions in later life. Recently some studies have shown an effect of high temperature on preterm births, but evidences are still inconclusive. Our objective is to analyse the effect of high temperature on preterm birth in a 10 years cohort of new-born in Rome. Materials and methods All singleton live-births in hospitals of Rome, from women residents in Rome, between 2001 and 2010, during the warm season (1st April-31st October) were analysed, excluding caesarean section and congenital malformation (Source of data: Lazio Region Certificate of Delivery Care Register). Births occurred between the 22nd and the 36th week plus 6 days since the date of the last menstrual period were defined as preterm. Exposure was the daily level of maximum apparent temperature (MAT) in the last week before delivery (Airport city station). The shape and lag dimension of the heat-preterm birth relationship was tested using a GAM and a distributed lag model respectively. The effect was evaluated through a Poisson GAM model, with MAT as a linear term, controlling for seasonal and long term trends, day of the week, holidays, and air pollutants (PM10, NO2, and O3). Results A cohort of 77,965 births was enrolled, including 4,272 preterm; of these 3,799 were born between the 33rd and the 36th week of gestation. We analysed data including and excluding births between the 22nd and the 32nd week of gestation to avoid confounding by gestational age. The effect of MAT appears linear when analysed only during the warm season. The percent change increase in preterm births between the 29th and the 36th week of gestation for 1 °C increase in MAT in the last 3 days before delivery is of 1.246 (IC 95 % 0.270-2.230). We didn't find a significant effect for exposure lagged on the last 7 days before delivery, and no independent effect by air pollutants.

Objective To identify and characterize individual and environmental risk factors associated with MBD hospitalizations with a concurrent HRI diagnosis. Methods This study uses hospitalization data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001-2010). Descriptive analyses of primary and secondary diagnoses of MBDs with an HRI were examined. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated from multivariable models to identify risk factors for hospitalizations among patients with mental illnesses and/or behavioral disorders and HRI. Results Nondependent alcohol/drug abuse, dementia, and schizophrenia were among the disorders that were associated with increased frequency of HRI hospitalizations among MBD patients. Increased risk of MBD hospitalizations with HRI was observed for Males (RR, 3.06), African Americans (RR, 1.16), Native Americans (RR, 1.70), uninsured (RR, 1.92), and those 40 years and older, compared to MBD hospitalizations alone. Conclusions Previous studies outside the U.S. have found that dementia and schizophrenia are significant risk factors for HRI hospitalizations. Our results suggest that hospitalizations among substance abusers may also be an important risk factor associated with heat morbidity. Improved understanding of these relative risks could help inform future public health strategies.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.1371/journal.pone.0186509,"POISSON REGRESSION APPROACH;CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY;DRUG-USE;WAVES;ADMISSIONS;CLIMATE;TEMPERATURE;MORBIDITY;HEATWAVES;IMPACTS;Mentally Ill Persons;Mental Disorders;Hospitals, Psychiatric",,

We explored potential underlying reasons by analysing clinically similar cardiovascular disease groups taking into account primary, underlying and immediate causes of death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed associations of daytime maximum temperature in relation to cardiovascular deaths and emergency hospital admissions between 1998 and 2016 in Switzerland. We applied conditional quasi-Poisson models with non-linear distributed lag functions to estimate relative risks (RRs) of daily cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for temperature increases from the median (22degreeC) to the 98th percentile (32degreeC) of the warm season temperature distribution with 10 days of lag. Cardiovascular mortality (n = 163,856) increased for total cardiovascular disease (RR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.19) and the disease groups hypertension (1.18, 1.02-1.38), arrhythmia (1.29, 1.08-1.55), heart failure (1.22, 1.05-1.43) and stroke of unknown origin (1.20, 1.02-1.4). In contrast, emergency hospital admissions (n = 447,577) decreased for total cardiovascular disease (0.91, 0.88-0.94), hypertension (0.72, 0.64-0.81), heart failure (0.83, 0.76-0.9) and myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.82-0.95). Opposing heat effects were most pronounced for disease groups associated with diuretic and antihypertensive drug use, with the age group >=75 years at highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: Volume depletion and vasodilation from heat stress plausibly explain the risk reduction of heat-related emergency hospital admissions for hypertension and heart failure. Since primary cause of death mostly refers to the underlying chronic disease, the seemingly paradoxical heat-related mortality increase can plausibly be explained by an exacerbation of heat effects by antihypertensive and diuretic drugs. Clinical guidelines should consider recommending strict therapy monitoring of such medication during heatwaves, particularly in the elderly.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.4414/SMW.2021.w30013,Aged;Cardiovascular Diseases/ep [Epidemiology];*Cardiovascular Diseases;*Heat Stress Disorders;Hot Temperature;Humans;Morbidity;Switzerland/ep [Epidemiology];Switzerland,,

Factors influencing this seasonal variation remain unclear. Our purpose was to determine to what extent temperature and influenza play a role. METHODS Using Poisson time series models, we examined the association between weekly mortality (all-cause and ischemic heart disease (IHD] related) and apparent temperature (temp) (human-perceived temperature calculated from temperature and humidity) for Texas (TX) and Los Angeles County (LA) from 1/1/05 through 12/31/08. Effect modification of this association by weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) was explored (defined as fever and cough / sore throat). ILI is expressed as the % of total patient visits due to ILI as reported by participating health care providers (urgent care clinics, ERs, etc.). RESULTS We found that temp correlated significantly with total and IHD deaths in both TX and LA (p<0.01 in all models except IHD in LA). However, the relationship between temp and deaths differed. In both locations total and IHD deaths increased during extreme cold. In LA, but not in TX, total and IHD deaths also increased during extreme heat. After adjustment for these temperature effects, we found that ILI correlated significantly with total and IHD deaths in both TX and LA (p<0.01 in all models). The Figure shows the very similar annual and intermediate peaks (stars) in both IHD deaths and ILI in TX. An increase in ILI resulted in increased mortality with a larger effect for IHD deaths than total deaths (20% and 19% higher for TX and LA, respectively). CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that people living in different climates respond differently to changes in apparent temperature. TX has hotter summers than LA, but deaths did not increase in TX during extreme heat suggesting an acclimation phenomenon. Respiratory infection is significantly associated with total and especially IHD deaths throughout the year and especially during annual peaks.",Suppl.

This study was conducted to assess the impact of heat and cold waves on mortality in Urmia city, which has a cold and mountainous climate. Distributed Lag Non-linear Models combined with a quasi-Poisson regression were used to assess the impact of heat (HW) and cold waves (CW) on mortality in subgroups, controlled for potential confounders such as long-term trend of daily mortality, day of week effect, holidays, mean temperature, humidity, wind speed and air pollutants. The heat/cold effect was divided into two general categories A-main effect (the effect caused by temperature), B-added effect (the effect caused by persistence of extreme temperature). Results show that there was no relation between HW and respiratory and cardiovascular death, but in main effects, HW(H1) significantly increased, the risk of Non-Accidental Death (NAD) in lag 0 (Cumulative Excess Risk (CER) (NAD) = 31(CI; 4-65)). Also in added effects, HW had a significant effect on NAD (CER (H1; NAD; lag;0-2) = 31(CI; 5, 51), CER (H2; NAD; lag;0-2) = 26(CI; 6, 48)). There was no relation between CW and respiratory death and cardiovascular death, but in added effects, CW((C1)) significantly decreased, the risk of non-accidental death in initial lags (CER (C1; NAD; lag;0-2) = 19 (CI; 35, 2)).

METHODS: Two data sources were analysed: archived case files of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing from 2010 through 2020; and a Severe Injury Reports (SIR) database of work-related hospitalisations that employers reported to federal OSHA from 2015 to 2020. Confirmed, probable and possible cases of HR-AKI were ascertained by serum creatinine measurements and narrative incident descriptions. Industry-specific incidence rates of HR-AKI were computed. A capture-recapture analysis assessed under-reporting in SIR. RESULTS: There were 608 HR-AKI cases, including 22 confirmed cases and 586 probable or possible cases. HR-AKI occurred in indoor and outdoor industries including manufacturing, construction, mail and package delivery, and solid waste collection. Among confirmed cases, 95.2% were male, 50.0% had hypertension and 40.9% were newly hired workers. Incidence rates of AKI hospitalisations from 1.0 to 2.5 hours per 100 000 workers per year were observed in high-risk industries. Analysis of overlap between the data sources found that employers reported only 70.6% of eligible HR-AKI hospitalisations to OSHA, and only 41.2% of reports contained a consistent diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Workers were hospitalised with HR-AKI in diverse industries, including indoor facilities. Because of under-reporting and underascertainment, national surveillance databases underestimate the true burden of occupational HR-AKI. Clinicians should consider kidney risk from recurrent heat stress. Employers should provide interventions, such as comprehensive heat stress prevention programmes, that include acclimatisation protocols for new workers, to prevent HR-AKI.","Shi, Dallas S     Weaver, Virginia M     Hodgson, Michael J     Tustin, Aaron W     eng     England     2021/11/10     Occup Environ Med. 2022 Mar;79(3):184-191. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2021-107933.

In light of the reported climate change trends, it is important to understand the burden of CVDs attributable to temperature, both hot and cold. The association between CVDs and temperature is region-specific, with relatively few studies focusing on low-and middle-income countries. This study investigates this association in Puducherry, a district in southern India lying on the Bay of Bengal, for the first time. METHODS: Using in-hospital CVD mortality data and climate data from the Indian Meteorological Department, we analyzed the association between apparent temperature (T<sub>app</sub>) and in-hospital CVD mortalities in Puducherry between 2011 and 2020. We used a case-crossover model with a binomial likelihood distribution combined with a distributed lag non-linear model to capture the delayed and non-linear trends over a 21-day lag period to identify the optimal temperature range for Puducherry. The results are expressed as the fraction of CVD mortalities attributable to heat and cold, defined relative to the optimal temperature. We also performed stratified analyses to explore the associations between T<sub>app</sub> and age-and-sex, grouped and considered together, and different types of CVDs. Sensitivity analyses were performed, including using a quasi-Poisson time-series approach. RESULTS: We found that the optimal temperature range for Puducherry is between 30degreeC and 36degreeC with respect to CVDs. Both cold and hot non-optimal T<sub>app</sub> were associated with an increased risk of overall in-hospital CVD mortalities, resulting in a U-shaped association curve. Cumulatively, up to 17% of the CVD deaths could be attributable to non-optimal temperatures, with a slightly higher burden attributable to heat (9.1%) than cold (8.3%). We also found that males were more vulnerable to colder temperature; females above 60 years were more vulnerable to heat while females below 60 years were affected by both heat and cold. Mortality with cerebrovascular accidents was associated more with heat compared to cold, while ischemic heart diseases did not seem to be affected by temperature. CONCLUSION: Both heat and cold contribute to the burden of CVDs attributable to non-optimal temperatures in the tropical Puducherry. Our study also identified the age-and-sex and CVD type differences in temperature attributable CVD mortalities.

METHODS: We used a case-crossover study to estimate the total effect of temperature on cardiovascular mortality in Rio de Janeiro between 2001 and 2018, and the effect modification by individual-level and neighbourhood-level factors. Individual-level factors included sex, age, colour/race, education, and place of death. Neighbourhood-level characteristics included social development index (SDI), income, electricity consumption and demographic change. We used conditional Poisson regression models combined with distributed lag non-linear models, adjusted for humidity and public holidays. RESULTS: Our results suggest a higher vulnerability to high temperatures among the elderly, women, non-hospitalised deaths, and people with a lower education level. Vulnerability to low temperatures was higher among the elderly, men, non-white people, and for primary education level. As for neighbourhood-level factors, we identified greater vulnerability to low and high temperatures in places with lower SDI, lower income, lower consumption of electricity, and higher demographic growth.

Understanding the effects of extreme events on health is a central issue for developing climate policies focused on the population's health.Objectives: We investigated the effects of heat waves on mortality in the Brazilian Amazon, examining effect modification according to various heat wave definitions, population subgroups, and causes of death.Methods: We included all 32 Amazonian municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The study period was from 2000 to 2018. We obtained mortality data from the Information Technology Department of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System, and meteorological data were derived from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. Heat waves were defined according to their intensity (90th; 92.5th; 95th; 97.5th and 99th temperature percentiles) and duration (>= 2, >= 3, and >= 4 days). In each city, we used a time-stratified case-crossover study to estimate the effects of each heat wave definition on mortality, according to population subgroup and cause of death. The lagged effects of heat waves were estimated using conditional Poisson regression combined with distributed lag non-linear models. Models were adjusted for specific humidity and public holidays. Risk ratios were pooled for the Brazilian Amazon using a univariate random-effects meta-analysis.Results: The pooled relative risks (RR) for mortality from total non-external causes varied between 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06), for the less stringent heat wave definition, and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04-1.33) for the more stringent definition. The mortality risk rose as the heat wave intensity increased, although the increase from 2 to 3, and 3-4 days was small. Although not statistically different, our results suggest a higher mortality risk for the elderly, this was also higher for women than men, and for cardiovascular causes than for non-external or respiratory ones.Conclusions: Heat waves were associated with a higher risk of mortality from non-external causes and cardiovascular diseases. Heat wave intensity played a more important role than duration in determining this risk. Suggestive evidence indicated that the elderly and women were more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves on mortality.","Silveira, Ismael Henrique     Hartwig, Shaiana Vilella     Moura, Mauricio Nascimento     Cortes, Taisa Rodrigues     Junger, Washington Leite     Cirino, Glauber     Ignotti, Eliane     de Oliveira, Beatriz Fatima Alves     eng     Meta-Analysis     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Germany     2023/01/05     Int J Hyg Environ Health. 2023 Mar;248:114109. doi: 10.1016/j.ijheh.2022.114109.

In this study, we investigated the total effect of temperature on cardiovascular mortality in 27 Brazilian cities, and the effect modification by geographic, socioeconomic, demographic and infrastructure characteristics within cities. METHODS: In the city-specific analysis, we used time-series analyses to estimate the relationship between mean temperature and daily cardiovascular mortality using quasi-Poisson generalized linear models combined with distributed lag non-linear models. In the second stage, a meta-analysis was used to pool the effects of temperature on cardiovascular mortality for Brazil and its five regions (Central-West, North, Northeast, South, and Southeast). We used a meta-regression to examine the effect modification of city-specific geographic, socioeconomic, demographic and infrastructure-related variables. RESULTS: The risks associated with temperature varied across the locations. Higher cardiovascular mortality was associated with low and high temperatures in most of the cities, Brazil and the Central-West, North, South, and Southeast regions. The overall relative risk (RR) for Brazil was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.35) for the 1st percentile of temperature and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01-1.13) for the 99th percentile of temperature versus the 79th percentile (27.7degreeC), where RR was lowest. The temperature range was the variable that best explained the variation in effects among the cities, with greater effects in locations having a broader range. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate effects of low and high temperatures on the risk of cardiovascular mortality in most of Brazil's capital cities, besides a pooled effect for Brazil and the Central-West, North, South, and Southeast regions. These findings can help inform public policies addressing the health impact of temperature extremes, especially in the context of climate change.","Silveira, Ismael Henrique     Oliveira, Beatriz Fatima Alves     Cortes, Taisa Rodrigues     Junger, Washington Leite     eng     Netherlands     2019/07/22     Sci Total Environ. 2019 Nov 15;691:996-1004. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.493.

Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified the geographic location for 581 813 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of a UTI and 56 630 773 non-UTI hospitalisations in the United States. Next, we used data from the National Climatic Data Center to estimate the monthly average temperature for each location. Using a case-control design, we modelled the odds of a hospital admission having a primary diagnosis of UTI as a function of demographics, payer, location, patient severity, admission month, year and the average temperature for the admission month. We found, after controlling for patient factors and month of admission, the odds of a UTI diagnosis increased with higher temperatures in a dose-dependent manner. For example, relative to months with average temperatures of 5-7.5 degreeC, an admission in a month with an average temperature of 27.5-30 degreeC has 20% higher odds of a primary diagnosis of UTI. However, in months with extremely high average temperatures (above 30 degreeC), the odds of a UTI admissions decrease, perhaps due to changes in behaviour.

The strength of this association varied across studies, limiting the ability to quantify potential benefits of SCT-screening policies for competitive athletics and military service members. We determined the relative rate and attributable risk of developing EHI associated with being SCT positive and the EHI health care utilization. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among U.S. enlisted, active duty service members during 1992-2012 from the Department of Defense Military Healthcare System databases. All 15,081 SCT-positive individuals and a sample of 60,320 from those considered SCT negative were followed through 2013 for EHI outcomes ranging from mild heat illness to heat stroke. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio for EHI in SCT-positive compared with SCT-negative individuals was 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.45). Risk factors for EHI included age over 30 yr at enlistment, female gender, Marine Corps, combat occupations, and enlistment between April and June. An estimated 216 Department of Defense enlistees (95% confidence interval: 147, 370) would need to be screened to identify and potentially prevent one case of EHI. The attributable risk of EHI due to SCT was 33% (95% confidence interval 19, 45%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SCT screening will identify approximately a third of SCT individuals at risk for EHI, but does not provide definitive evidence for universal compared with selective (e.g., occupational based) in military enlistees. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed for policy makers to assess the overall value of universal SCT screening to prevent morbidity and mortality in both the military and the collegiate athletic populations.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.1093/milmed/usx085,Adolescent;Adult;Cohort Studies;Female;Heat Stress Disorders/ep [Epidemiology];*Heat Stress Disorders/et [Etiology];Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Male;Military Personnel/ed [Education];*Military Personnel/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];Physical Exertion/ph [Physiology];Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;*Sickle Cell Trait/co [Complications];Sickle Cell Trait/ep [Epidemiology];Teaching/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];United States;Sickle Cell Trait,,

Many of the subpopulations most vulnerable to heat-related mortality are in prisons, facilities that may exacerbate temperature exposures. Yet, there is scare literature on the impacts of heat among incarcerated populations. We analyzed data on mortality in U.S. state and private prisons from 2001-2019 linked to daily maximum temperature data for the months of June, July, and August. Using a case-crossover approach and distributed lag models, we estimated the association of increasing temperatures with total mortality, heart disease-related mortality, and suicides. We also examined the association with extreme heat and heatwaves (days above the 90th percentile for the prison location) and assessed effect modification by personal, facility, and regional characteristics. There were 12,836 deaths during summer months. The majority were male (96%) and housed in a state-operated prison (97%). A 10..F increase was associated with a 5.2% (95% CI: 1.5%, 9.0%) increase in total mortality and a 6.7% (95% CI: -0.6%, 14.0%) increase in heart disease mortality. The association between temperature and suicides was delayed, peaking around lag 3 (exposure at three days prior death). Two- and three-day heatwaves were associated with increased total mortality of 5.5% (95% CI: 0.3%, 10.9%) and 7.4% (95% CI: 1.6%, 13.5%), respectively. The cumulative effect (lags 1-3) of an extreme heat day was associated with a 22.8% (95% CI: 3.3%, 46.0%) increase in suicides. We found the greatest increase in mortality among people ... 65 years old, incarcerated less than one year, held in the Northeast region, and in urban or rural counties.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated associations between exposure to heat/heat waves during the last week of gestation and preterm birth (PTB) in North Carolina (NC) and evaluated effect modification by residential greenness, urbanicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: We obtained individual-level NC birth certificate data for May-September 2003-2014. We estimated daily mean temperature at each maternal residential address using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data. We created 3 definitions of heat waves (daily temperature >=95th, 97th, 99th percentile for NC warm season temperature, for >=2 consecutive days). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to assess residential greenness. Community-level modifiers (e.g., income, urbanicity) were considered. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between exposure to heat/heat waves and PTB, controlling for covariates. Stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate whether the association between heat and PTB varied by several individual and community characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 546,441 births, 8% were preterm. Heat exposure during the last week before delivery was significantly associated with risk of PTB. The hazard ratio for a 1 degreeC increase in temperature during the last week before delivery was 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02). Higher heat-PTB risk was associated with some characteristics (e.g., areas that were urbanized, low SES, or in the Coastal Plain). We also found significant PTB-heat risk in areas with low greenness for urbanized area. For heat waves, we did not find significantly positive associations with PTB.

We investigated effect modification by individual (infant's sex, mother's age, and mother's educational level) and community characteristics (socioeconomic status (SES) and percentage of green areas near residence at the gu level, which is similar to borough in Western countries). We also evaluated associations by combinations of individual- and community-level SES. RESULTS: Heat exposure during whole pregnancy was significantly associated with risk of preterm birth. An interquartile (IQR) increase (5.5degreeC) in heat index during whole pregnancy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.033 (95% CI 1.005, 1.061) with NO<sub>2</sub> adjustment, and 1.028 (95% CI 0.998, 1.059) with PM<sub>10</sub> adjustment, for preterm birth. We also found significant associations with heat exposure during 4 weeks before delivery and 1 week before delivery on preterm birth. We did not observe significant associations with term low birth weight. Higher risk of heat on preterm birth was associated with some individual characteristics such as infants with younger or older mothers and lower community-level SES. For combinations of individual- and community-level SES, the highest and most significant estimated effect was found for infants with low educated mothers living in low SES communities, with suggestions of effects of both individual-and community-level SES. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for evaluating impacts of high temperatures on birth outcomes, estimating health impacts of climate change, and identifying which subpopulations and factors are most relevant for disparities in this association.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.1016/j.envres.2018.10.032,"Female;*Hot Temperature;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Male;Pregnancy;*Premature Birth;Republic of Korea;Seoul;Temperature;Korea",,

A quasi-Poisson generalised linear model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was performed to quantify this association. The results indicated that (i) ambient temperature related to respiratory ED visits exhibited a U-shaped association. The minimum-morbidity temperature was 21.5degreeC. (ii) the peak relative risk (RR) of cold spells on respiratory ED visits was observed in relatively mild cold spells with a threshold below the 3rd percentile for 4days (RR=1.885, 95% CI: 1.300-2.734), and there was a reduction in risk during extremely chilly cold spells (RR=1.811, 95% CI: 1.229-2.667). However, the risk of heat waves increased with the thresholds, and the greatest risk was found for extremely hot heat waves (RR=1.932, 95% CI: 1.461-2.554). (iii) the added effect of heat waves was small, and we observed that the added heat wave effect only introduced additional risk in females (RR=1.166, 95% CI: 1.007-1.349). No added effect of cold spells was identified. In conclusion, the main effects of heat waves and cold spells on respiratory ED visits showed different change trends.

The registration number is PROSPERO-CRD42016047179. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Global Health were systematically searched to identify systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed quality. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist Was used to assess the methodological quality of included systematic reviews. Estimates of morbidity and mortality risk in association with heat exposure, cold exposure, heatwaves, cold spells and diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs) were the primary outcomes. Twenty-eight systematic reviews were included in the overview of systematic reviews. (i) The median (interquartile range) AMSTAR scores were 7 (1.75) for quantitative reviews and 3.5 (1.75) for qualitative reviews. (ii) Heat exposure was identified to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality, but was not found to have an impact on cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity. (iii) Reanalysis of the meta-analyses indicated that cold-induced cardiovascular morbidity increased in youth and middle-age (RR = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.004-1.015) as well as the elderly (RR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.007-1.018). (iv) The definitions of temperature exposure adopted by different studies included various temperature indicators and thresholds. In conclusion, heat exposure seemed to have an adverse effect on mortality and cold-induced cardiovascular morbidity increased in the elderly. Developing definitions of temperature exposure at the regional level may contribute to more accurate evaluations of the health effects of temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the study was to evaluate heat-related in-hospital mortality using a multi-city case-crossover analysis. METHODS: We studied residents of four Italian cities, aged 65+ years, who died during 1997-2004. For 94,944 individuals who died in hospital and were hospitalised two or more days before death, demographics, chronic conditions, primary diagnoses of last event and hospital wards were considered. A city-specific case-crossover analysis was performed to evaluate the association between apparent temperature and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (OR) of dying on a day with a temperature of 30 degrees C compared to a day with a temperature of 20 degrees C were estimated with a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We estimated an overall OR of 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.25, 1.39). Age, marital status and hospital ward were important risk indicators. Patients in general medicine were at higher risk than those in high and intensive care units. A history of psychiatric disorders and cerebrovascular diseases gave a higher vulnerability. Mortality was greater among patients hospitalised for heart failure, stroke and chronic pulmonary diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality is strongly associated with high temperatures.

During this period . there was a total of 138 cases occurring in 132 soldiers. The daily maximum dry-bulb temperature and various heat stress indices were related to the number of cases occurring each day. The dry-bulb temperature was the most satisfactory expression of the likelihood of occurrence of heat injury. No reasonable method is apparent for prediction of the occurrence of heat injury in advance, although the Weather Bureau's predicted high for the day plus 5° (F.) approximated the observed readings on most days. Acclimatization is obviously an important factor in the prevention of heat injury but does not provide a solid immunity. Excessive exertion can break through the protective effect of acclimatization. From these data, persons 20 to 24 yr. of age are less susceptible than those older or younger There is slight indication that white may be more susceptible than Negroes. Obesity is clearly associated with an increased risk of heat injury. The most promising approach to prevention and control of this illness depends on a consideration of the occurrence of numbers of cases in the same unit at the same time. When this occurs, the reason is usually apparent - injudicious exposure or exertion. These events are directly controlled by the company officers and noncommissioned officers, and prevention depends on their awareness of the problem. Sporadic cases are probably the result of unusual individual susceptibility and are not preventable in a military situation.","STALLONES, R A     GAULD, R L     DODGE, H J     LAMMERS, T F     eng     1957/06/01     AMA Arch Ind Health. 1957 Jun;15(6):455-65. | RAYYAN-LABELS: new",,acclimatization;army;climate;epidemiology;exercise;exposure;general aspects of disease;heat injury;heat stress;immunity;Black person;obesity;prediction;prevention;prevention and control;reading;risk;military personnel;solid;temperature;weather;Hot Temperature,,

However, multi-city studies on the association between both high and low temperatures and mortality of nervous system diseases were scarce, especially on the evidence of vulnerable populations. Methods: Weekly meteorological data, air pollution data and mortality data of nervous system were collected in 5 cities in China. A quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to quantify the association between extreme temperatures and mortality of nervous system diseases. Multivariate meta analysis was applied to estimate the pooled effects at the overall levels. The attributable fractions (AFs) were calculated to assess the mortality burden attributable to both high and low temperatures. Stratified analyses were also performed by gender and age-groups through the above steps. Results: A total of 12,132 deaths of nervous system diseases were collected in our study. The overall minimum mortality temperature was 23.9 degrees C (61.9th), the cumulative relative risks of extreme heat and cold for nervous system diseases were 1.33(95%CI: 1.10, 1.61) and 1.47(95%CI: 1.27, 1.71). The mortality burden attributed to non-optimal temperatures accounted for 29.54% (95%eCI: 13.45%, 40.52%), of which the mortality burden caused by low temperature and high temperature accounted for 25.89% (95%eCI: 13.03%, 34.36%) and 3.65% (95%eCI: 0.42%, 6.17%), respectively. The mortality burden attributable to ambient temperature was higher in both males and the elderly (>74 years old), with the AF of 31.85% (95%eCI: 20.68%, 39.88%) and 31.14% (95%eCI: -6.83%, 49.51%), respectively. Conclusions: The non-optimal temperature can increase the mortality of nervous system diseases and the males and the elderly over 74 years have the highest attributable burden.

Methods: The present study analyzed data on emergency department visits for upper urolithiasis from three hospital sites of a large hospital in Hefei, China, during 2016–2020. Data on environmental factors during the same period were also analyzed. A time series analysis employing a generalized Poisson regression model (GPRM) combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was conducted to evaluate the effect of ambient temperature on the number of emergency department visits for upper urolithiasis. Results: We found that ambient temperatures above 9 °C were positively associated with the frequency of upper urolithiasis visits, with the relationship being most significant on the current day and with a one-day lag. In the single-day lag effect, the most significant relative risk (RR) for mild heat (75th percentile) and high heat (95th percentile) was 1.229 (95% CI: 1.100–1.373) and 1.337 (95% CI: 1.134–1.577), respectively. The cumulative lag effect was significantly higher than the single-day lag effect, with maximum relative risks (RRs) of 1.779 (95% CI: 1.356–2.335) and 2.498 (95% CI: 1.688–3.697), respectively. The maximum lag time was 7 days. RRs were also higher among women and individuals aged 30–44 years. Conclusions: Increased ambient temperature is a risk factor for upper urolithiasis, and there is a hysteresis effect. Women and individuals aged 30–44 years are the most susceptible. © 2023","Sun, Haoxiang     Wang, Xiaosong     Zhang, Xiaoyu     Wang, Linlin     Tao, Min     Wang, Ying     Yang, Jidan     Lei, Yuting     Jin, Changqing     Zhao, Shuang     Hu, Yue     Hu, Huaqing     eng     England     2023/01/31     Heliyon. 2023 Jan 16;9(1):e12856. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e12856. eCollection 2023 Jan. | RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e12856,China;Emergencies;Temperature,,

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the temporal variations in both temperature-respiratory hospitalizations associations and temperature-related attributable risks in Hong Kong. METHODS: We collected 17-year time-series data on daily ambient temperature and emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases between 2000 and 2016 in Hong Kong. Quasi-Poisson regression with a time-varying distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the year-specific association between temperature and respiratory hospitalizations [total respiratory, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] and the year-specific attributable fraction (AF) for heat and cold (defined as above/below the optimum temperature, respectively). RESULTS: Heat-related risks and AFs increased continuously for total respiratory, pneumonia and COPD hospitalizations during the past 17years, respectively. Cold-hospitalization associations and cold-related AFs showed heterogeneous patterns, showing a decreasing trend for pneumonia but a general increasing trend for COPD for both the associations and AFs. The total temperature-related AFs remained stable for total respiratory (p for trend=0.136) and pneumonia (p for trend=0.406), but showed an increasing trend for COPD (p for trend<0.001) from 10% (95% empirical CI: 2%, 17%) in 2000 to 17% (95% empirical CI: 11%, 22%) in 2016.

DESIGN: Time stratified case crossover analyses with distributed lag non-linear models. SETTING: US nationwide administrative healthcare claims database. PARTICIPANTS: All commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (74.2 million) aged 18 years and older between May and September 2010 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily rates of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mental disorders based on discharge diagnosis codes. RESULTS: 21 996 670 ED visits were recorded among adults with health insurance living in 2939 US counties. Days of extreme heat-defined as the 95th centile of the local warm season (May through September) temperature distribution (at 34.4degreeC v 14.9degreeC national average level)-were associated with a 7.8% (95% confidence interval 7.3% to 8.2%) excess relative risk of ED visits for any cause, 66.3% (60.2% to 72.7%) for heat related illness, 30.4% (23.4% to 37.8%) for renal disease, and 7.9% (5.2% to 10.7%) for mental disorders. Days of extreme heat were associated with an excess absolute risk of ED visits for heat related illness of 24.3 (95% confidence interval 22.9 to 25.7) per 100 000 people at risk per day. Heat was not associated with a higher risk of ED visits for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Associations were more pronounced among men and in counties in the north east of the US or with a continental climate. CONCLUSIONS: Among both younger and older adults, days of extreme heat are associated with a higher risk of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, and mental disorders.

Objectives: To evaluate the association between days of extreme heat and cold and risk of preterm birth among similar to 32 million live singleton births between 1989 and 2002 across 403 counties in the contiguous United States (US). Methods: We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between population-weighted daily mean temperature and risk of preterm birth in each county and then pooled results across geographic regions and climate zones. We defined extreme heat and cold as the 95th and 5th percentile of the county-specific temperatures, respectively. Results: Preterm birth accounted for 9.3% of deliveries. There was a monotonic association between ambient temperature and risk of preterm birth. Days of extreme heat and cold were associated with a relative risk of preterm birth of 1.025 (95% CI: 1.015, 1.036) and 0.985 (95% CI: 0.976, 0.993) over the subsequent four days, respectively, relative to the county-specific median temperature.

Extreme heat was more strongly associated with preterm birth in regions with colder and drier climates, and among younger women. Days of extreme cold temperature were associated with lower rather than higher risk of preterm birth.

The current study estimates the impacts of temperature and heat waves on emergency department visits (EDV) and emergency ambulance dispatches (EAD) using time-series approaches in Pudong, from 2011 to 2013. METHODS: An over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model was used to examine the association between temperature and EDV and EAD. Heat wave effects with different heat wave definitions considering both the intensity and durations were also estimated. RESULTS: Immediate effects of temperature on EDV and EAD were detected, after controlling for trends of time and day of week. The exposure-response relationships showed J-shaped curves with higher threshold temperature of EDV than that of EAD visually. When estimating risk changes on heat days compared with non-heat days using different percentiles of daily mean temperature in definition, EAD showed significant increases while non-significant or even negative associations were found for EDV.

Few studies have examined the impact of heat waves on mortality in Asia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of the heat wave in 2013 on mortality among the registered permanent residence population and identify susceptible subpopulations in Pudong New Area. METHODS: To model the relationship between the maximum temperature and mortality, a quasi-poisson generalized additive model was applied using data from 1 January 2008 to 15 June 2013. Extrapolating the model the estimated daily expected number of deaths was calculated over the period of 16 June 2013 to 15 September 2013. RESULTS: There were four heat waves in 2013, causing 167 (95% CI: 46-280) excess deaths in all-cause mortality, corresponding to an excess mortality of 10.51%. After the first two heat waves, the cumulative excess death counts gradually reduced to the level before the start of the heat waves. In contrast, the cumulative excess death numbers increased rapidly during the last two heat waves, without decreasing after the heat waves. Females (male: 10.43%, female: 11.79%) and people aged >= 80 years old (excess deaths were 129 (95% CI: 47-203) and excess mortality was 16.64%) were strongly affected by the heat waves. The excess mortalities of cardiovascular and respiratory disease were 22.34% and 20.68% respectively, which were higher than that of all-cause deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The 2013 heat wave had a significant impact on mortality even after the considered ""mortality displacement"". Females and people aged >= 80 years old were significantly vulnerable to the heat waves. The observed excess mortalities of cardiovascular and respiratory disease were higher than all-cause deaths. These results could provide scientific evidences for policy makers to frame heat wave-related prevention measures, which may help in reducing the mortality.","Sun, Xiaoming     Sun, Qiao     Zhou, Xianfeng     Li, Xiaopan     Yang, Minjuan     Yu, Aiqing     Geng, Fuhai     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2014/07/08     Sci Total Environ. 2014 Sep 15;493:789-94. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.042.

We explore the mortality risk due to heat wave characteristics, including the timing in the seasons, the day of the heat wave, the intensity and the duration, and the modifying effect of temperature zones. METHODS: Heat waves were defined as >= 2 days with a temperature >=99th percentile for the county from 1 May through 30 September. Heat waves were characterized by their intensity, duration, timing in the season, and day of the heat wave. Within each county, we estimated the total non-accidental death and cardiovascular disease mortality during each heat wave compared with non-heat wave days by controlling for potential confounders in summer. We combined individual heat wave effect estimates using a random-effects model to calculate overall effects at the temperature zone and national levels. RESULTS: The average daily total number of non-accidental deaths was nine in the warm season (across all the counties). Approximately half of the daily total number of non-accidental deaths were cardiovascular-related deaths (approximately four persons per day). The average and maximum temperatures across the study area were 23.1 degreeC (range: -1.2-35.9 degreeC) and 28.3 degreeC (range: 5.4-42.8 degreeC), respectively. The average relative humidity during the study was 68.9% (range: 8.0-100.0%). Heat waves increase the risk of total non-accidental death by 15.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 12.5, 18.9] compared with non-heat wave periods, and the risk of cardiovascular-related death increases by 22.0% (95% CI: 16.9, 27.4). The risk of non-accidental death during the first heat wave of the season increases by 16.3% (95% CI: 12.6, 20.2), the risk during the second heat wave increases by 6.3% (95% CI: 2.8, 9.9) and during subsequent heat waves increases by -2.1% (95% CI: -4.6, 0.4). The first day and the second to third days of heat waves increase the risk of total non-accidental death by 11.7% (95% CI: 7.6, 15.9) and 17.0% (95% CI: 13.1, 21.0), respectively. Effects of heat waves on mortality lasted more than 4 days (6.3%, 95% CI: 2.4, 10.5) and are non-significantly different from the first day of heat waves. We found non-significant differences of the heat wave-associated mortality risks across mid-, warm and subtropical temperature zones.

Therefore, this ecological study was conducted to assess whether this association is also significant in Taiwan and the characteristics of the relationship. Daily mean heat indices, from 1994 through 2008, were used as the predictor for the risk of increased mortality in populations from 6 major Taiwanese cities. Daily mortality data from 1994 through 2008 were retrieved from the Taiwan Death Registry, Department of Health, Taiwan, and meteorological data were acquired from the Central Weather Bureau. Poisson regression analyses using generalized linear models were applied to estimate the temperature-mortality relationship. Daily mean heat indices were calculated and used as the temperature metric. Overall, increased risk ratios in mortality were associated with increased daily mean heat indices. Significantly increased risk ratios of daily mortality were evident when daily mean heat indices were at and above the 95th percentile, when compared to the lowest percentile, in all cities. These risks tended to increase similarly among those aged 65 years and older; a phenomenon seen in the cities of Keelung, Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, but not Chiayi. Being more vulnerable to heat stress is likely restricted to a short-term effect, as suggested by lag models which showed that there was dominantly an association during the period of 0 to 3 days. In Taiwan, predicting city-specific daily mean heat indices may provide a useful early warning system for increased mortality risk, especially for the elderly. Regional differences in health vulnerabilities should be further examined in relation to the differential social-ecological systems that affect them.","Sung, Tzu-I     Wu, Pei-Chih     Lung, Shih-Chun     Lin, Chuan-Yao     Chen, Mu-Jean     Su, Huey-Jen     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2012/11/28     Sci Total Environ. 2013 Jan 1;442:275-81. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.068.

Statistical methods were used to carry out univariate and bivariate analyses while cartographic techniques allowed mapping of the main climatic and health indicators.

From health perspective, it was noted an increase in cases of consultation in health facilities as well as a rise in declared morbidity by households especially in the departments of Kanel (17.7%), Ranerou (16.1 %), Matam (13.7%) and Bakel (13.7%). The heat waves of May 2013 were also associated with cases of death with a reported mortality (observed by medical staff) of 12.4% unequally distributed according to the departments with a higher number of deaths in Matam (25, 2%) and in Bakel (23.5%) than in Podor (8.4%) and Kanel (0.8%). The morbidity and mortality distribution according to gender shows that women (57%) were more affected than men (43%). These health risks have been associated with a number of factors including age, access to drinkable water, type of fuel, type of housing and construction materials, existence of fan and an air conditioner, and health history.The heat wave recurrence has led to a frequency in certain diseases sensitive to rising temperatures, which is increasingly a public health issue in the Sahelian zone of Senegal.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.1007/s11356-022-21205-x,Climate;Temperature;Heat waves;Diseases;Health risks;Senegal;AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;MORTALITY;IMPACT;SURVEILLANCE;MORBIDITY;Hot Temperature,,

Gestational heat exposure is a well-established teratogen in animal studies, with a growing body of literature suggesting human pregnancies are similarly at risk. Characterization of extreme heat as a pregnancy risk is problematic due to nonstandard definitions of heat waves, and variable study designs. To better focus future research in this area, we conducted a scoping review to assess the effects of extreme heat on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review of epidemiological studies investigating gestational heat-exposure and published 2010 and 2020, was conducted with an emphasis on study design, gestational windows of sensitivity, adverse pregnancy outcomes and characterization of environmental temperatures. RESULTS: A sample of 84 studies was identified, predominantly set in high-income countries. Preterm birth, birthweight, congenital anomalies and stillbirth were the most common pregnancy outcome variables. Studies reported race/ethnicity and/or socioeconomic variables, however these were not always emphasized in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Use of precise temperature data by most studies avoided pitfalls of imprecise, regional definitions of heat waves, however inconsistent study design, and exposure windows are a significant challenge to systematic evaluation of this literature. Despite the high risk of extreme heat events and limited mitigation strategies in the global south, there is a significant gap in the epidemiological literature from these regions. Greater consistency in study design and exposure windows would enhance the rigor of this field.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Peter,10.3390/ijerph19042412,"Extreme Heat/ae [Adverse Effects];*Extreme Heat;Female;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Outcome/ep [Epidemiology];Premature Birth/ep [Epidemiology];Premature Birth/et [Etiology];*Premature Birth;Stillbirth;Temperature;Pregnancy Outcome;Extreme Heat;Hot Temperature",,

This study aims to utilize hourly temperature data to better capture the effects of cumulative and transient heat exposures on schizophrenia during the warm season in Hefei, China. We included the daily mean temperature and daily schizophrenia hospitalizations into the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to simulate the exposure-response curve and determine the heat threshold (19.4 degreeC). We calculated and applied a novel indicator-daily excess hourly heat (DEHH)-to examine the effects of cumulative heat exposure over a day on schizophrenia hospitalizations. Temperature measurements at each time point were also incorporated in the DLNM as independent exposure indicators to analyze the impact of transient heat exposure on schizophrenia. Each increment of interquartile range (IQR) in DEHH was associated with elevated risk of schizophrenia hospitalizations from lag 1 (RR = 1.036, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.016, 1.057) to lag 4 (RR = 1.025, 95% CI: 1.005, 1.046). Men and people over 40 years old were more susceptible to DEHH.

However, available evidence on the impact of prolonged high temperature (i.e., heatwave) on diabetes deaths is limited and whether urban and rural areas differ in heatwave vulnerability remains unknown so far. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was employed to estimate the association between heatwaves and diabetes deaths in 1486 districts (509 urban and 977 rural areas) of eastern China (Jiangsu Province), 2016-2019. For each decedent, residential heatwave exposure was measured by matching daily mean temperatures to the geocoded residential address. We adopted nine-tiered heatwave definitions incorporating intensity and duration. Stratified analyses by decedents' characteristics (gender, age, and education) were also conducted. During the study period, there were 18,685 deaths from diabetes (urban proportion: 36.95 %, p-value for urban-rural difference < 0.05). Heatwaves were associated with an increased risk of diabetes deaths, with greater and longer-lasting effects in rural areas than urban areas [e.g., rural odds ratio (OR): 1.19 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 1.25) vs. urban OR: 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.05, 1.12)]. Risk of diabetes deaths increased with the intensity of heatwaves in rural areas (p-value for trend <0.01), but not in urban areas. Stratified analyses in rural areas suggested that females and less-educated people were more vulnerable to heatwave-related diabetes deaths. Our findings revealed the urban-rural disparity in the risk of diabetes deaths associated with heatwaves. Rural diabetics should be made aware of the increased death risk posed by heatwaves in the context of warming climate.","Tao, Junwen     Zheng, Hao     Ho, Hung Chak     Wang, Xiling     Hossain, Mohammad Zahid     Bai, Zhongliang     Wang, Ning     Su, Hong     Xu, Zhiwei     Cheng, Jian     eng     Netherlands     2022/11/11     Sci Total Environ. 2023 Feb 1;858(Pt 2):160026. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160026.

METHODS: We used times series Poisson regression and distributed lag non-linear models to determine the relative risk of kidney stone occurrence associated with mean ambient daily temperatures among 60,221 patients living in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia who developed kidney stones between 2005 and 2011. Patient data were obtained from MarketScan, a claims database of over 145 million unique patients enrolled in more than 100 nongovernmental health insurance plans in all 50 states, and mean ambient daily temperatures were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. To fully capture the effect of daily temperatures, we calculated the cumulative risk of stone occurrence over a period of 20 days to estimate an overall risk for all daily temperatures that occurred in each city. Relative risks for nephrolithiasis were calculated referent to 50-F (10°C). RESULTS: We observed a dose response relationship between mean daily ambient temperatures and the risk of nephrolithiasis. The risk of kidney stone occurrence increased as mean daily temperatures increased above 50-F (Figure). At 86-F (30°C), the relative risk of stone occurrence was 1.38 in Atlanta (95% CI 1.07-1.79), 1.37 in Chicago (95% CI 1.07-1.76), 1.36 in Dallas (95% CI 1.10-1.69), 1.11 in Los Angeles (95% CI 0.73-1.68), and 1.47 in Philadelphia (95% CI 1.00-2.17). In Dallas, the relative risk of kidney stone occurrence stabilized at 36-38% as temperatures increased above 86-F. In Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia, the risk of nephrolithiasis increased throughout the upper temperature range of each city. No statistically significant association between temperature and stone occurrence was observed in Los Angeles, which had the fewest days above 80-F and the least variability in daily temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of kidney stones increases as mean ambient daily temperatures increase. The results will help provide a modeling framework of how climate change may affect the incidence of nephrolithiasis across the United States.(Figure Presented).",Suppl.

The objective of this study was to determine differences in the temperature dependence of kidney stone presentation by sex, age, race, climate, and insurance type. METHODS: We performed a time series study of 132,597 patients who presented with kidney stones to Emergency Departments in South Carolina from 1996-2015. Conditional Poisson regression and distributed lag non-linear models were used to assess the association and lagged response between daily temperature and kidney stone presentation stratified by sex, age, insurance type, race, and climate zone. RESULTS: The relative risk for a daily temperature at the 99th percentile versus 10°C was 1.72 (95% CI 1.55, 1.91) for men and 1.15 (95% CI 1.01, 1.31) for women. This difference was greatest among patients 20-65 years old. The risk of kidney stone presentation following moderately high daily temperatures was less among patients living in warmer climates. The temperature-dependence of stone presentation did not differ by race or insurance type. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of kidney stone presentation following high daily temperatures was substantially greater among men than women and similar between patients with public and private insurance, which suggests that the higher risk among men is due to the sexually dimorphic effect of heat on evaporative water loss rather than greater exposure to ambient temperature. The lower risk among patients living in warmer climates suggests that prolonged heat exposure may lead to adaptive responses that mitigate the effect of high temperatures on kidney stone presentation. These differences should be considered in secondary prevention strategies to increase fluid intake and projections of the effect of climate change on nephrolithiasis prevalence.

However, less evidence is available on the temperature effects on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, especially in China. In this study, we examined the relationship between ambient temperature and CHD mortality in Beijing, China during 2000 to 2011. In addition, we compared time series and time-stratified case-crossover models for the non-linear effects of temperature. Methods: We examined the effects of temperature on CHD mortality using both time series and time-stratified case-crossover models. We also assessed the effects of temperature on CHD mortality by subgroups: gender (female and male) and age (age > =65 and age < 65). We used a distributed lag non-linear model to examine the non-linear effects of temperature on CHD mortality up to 15 lag days. We used Akaike information criterion to assess the model fit for the two designs. Results: The time series models had a better model fit than time-stratified case-crossover models. Both designs showed that the relationships between temperature and group-specific CHD mortality were non-linear. Extreme cold and hot temperatures significantly increased the risk of CHD mortality. Hot effects were acute and short-term, while cold effects were delayed by two days and lasted for five days. The old people and women were more sensitive to extreme cold and hot temperatures than young and men. Conclusions: This study suggests that time series models performed better than time-stratified case-crossover models according to the model fit, even though they produced similar non-linear effects of temperature on CHD mortality. In addition, our findings indicate that extreme cold and hot temperatures increase the risk of CHD mortality in Beijing, China, particularly for women and old people. © 2012 Tian et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1186/1476-069X-11-56,adult;aged;aging;article;China;cold;correlation analysis;environmental temperature;female;heat;human;ischemic heart disease;major clinical study;male;mortality;nonlinear system;priority journal;risk factor;sex difference;statistical analysis;statistical model;time series analysis;time stratified case crossover model;Coronary Disease,,

Objectives: We aimed to find a best heat wave definition for CHD mortality; and explore the characteristic of heat wave effects on CHD in Beijing, China. Methods: We obtained daily data on weather and CHD mortality in Beijing for years 2000-2011. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to assess the short-term impact of heat waves on CHD mortality in hot season (May-September), while controlling for relative humidity, day of the week, long-term trend and season. We compared 18 heat wave definitions by combining heat wave thresholds (87.5th, 90.0th, 92.5th, 95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile of daily mean temperature) with different duration days (>= 2 to >= 4 days), using Akaike information criterion for quasi-Poisson. We examined whether heat wave effects on CHD mortality were modified by heat wave duration and timing. Results: Heat wave definition using 97.5th percentile of daily mean temperature (30.5 degrees C) and duration >= 2 days produced the best model fit. Based on this heat wave definition, we found that men and elderly were sensitive to the first heat waves of the season, while women and young were sensitive to the second heat waves. In general, the longer duration of heat waves increased the risks of CHD mortality more than shorter duration for elderly. The first two days of heat waves had the highest impact on CHD mortality. Women and elderly were at higher risks than men and young when exposed to heat waves, but the effect differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Heat waves had significant impact on CHD mortality. This finding may have implications for policy making towards protecting human health from heat waves.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1371/journal.pone.0077321,AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;CASE-CROSSOVER;COLD SPELLS;SAO-PAULO;IMPACT;RISK;CITY;Coronary Disease,,

METHODS: Data from 10 public EDs were analysed using a generalised additive model for disease categories, age groups and gender. RESULTS: Cumulative relative risks (RR) for non-external causes other than cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were 1.11 and 1.05 in most and least disadvantaged areas, respectively. The pattern persisted on lags 0-2. Elevated risks were observed for all age groups above 15 years in all areas. However, with RRs of 1.19-1.28, the 65-74 years age group in more disadvantaged areas stood out, compared with RR=1.08 in less disadvantaged areas. This pattern was observed on lag 0 but did not persist. The RRs for male presentations were 1.10 and 1.04 in most and less disadvantaged areas; for females, RR was 1.04 in less disadvantaged areas. This pattern persisted across lags 0-2. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-related ED visits increased during heatwaves. However, due to overlapping confidence intervals, variations across socioeconomic areas should be interpreted cautiously. IMPLICATIONS: ED data may be utilised for monitoring heat-related health impacts, particularly on the first day of heatwaves, to facilitate prompt interventions and targeted resource allocation.","Toloo, Ghasem Sam     Guo, Yuming     Turner, Lyle     Qi, Xin     Aitken, Peter     Tong, Shilu     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2014/08/30     Aust N Z J Public Health. 2014 Oct;38(5):430-5. doi: 10.1111/1753-6405.12253.

Aims: To examine the relation between maternal exposure to a heatwave during pregnancy and the risk of PTB (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) in Brisbane, Australia, during 2000-2010. Methods: We obtained the daily data, from relevant government agencies, on sociodemographic factors, air pollutants and meteorological factors and births for Brisbane, Australia, during 2000-2010. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between maternal exposure to a heatwave and the risk of PTB, after adjusting for maternal age, parity, indigenous status and infants' gender, socioeconomic index for area, relative humidity, air pressure and air pollution. Results: There was a statistically significant association between maternal exposure to a heatwave and the risk of PTB. The relative risk for PTB was 1.25 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.35), 1.15 (95 % CI 1.07-1.24), and 1.28 (95 % CI 1.18-1.39) for maternal exposure, in the 1st trimester, to a heatwave defined as daily maximum temperatures > the 90th percentile for 2, 3 or 4 days, respectively.

It is unknown whether such associations exist in subtropical nations like Vietnam. The study aim was to investigate whether hospital admissions for mental disorders may be triggered, or exacerbated, by heat exposure and heatwaves, in a low- and middle-income country, Vietnam. For this, we used data from the Hanoi Mental Hospital over five years (2008-2012) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on admissions for mental disorders. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression model accounting for seasonality, time trend, days of week, and mean humidity was used to analyse the relationship. Heatwave events were mainly studied as periods of three or seven consecutive days above the threshold of 35degreeC daily maximum temperature (90th percentile). The study result showed heatwaves increased the risk for admission in the whole group of mental disorders (F00-79) for more persistent heatwaves of at least 3 days when compared with non-heatwave periods. The relative risks were estimated at 1.04 (0.95-1.13), 1.15 (1.005-1.31), and 1.36 (1-1.90) for a one-, three- and seven-day heatwave, respectively. Admissions for mental disorders increased among men, residents in rural communities, and the elderly population during heatwaves. The groups of organic mental disorders, including symptomatic illnesses (F0-9) and mental retardation (F70-79), had increased admissions during heatwaves.

We retrospectively examined the data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan, for patients examined between 2000 and 2013. In total, 628 patients with a heat stroke episode were enrolled and matched with 1256 patients without any history of a heat stroke episode by propensity score matching at a ratio of 1:2.

An association between heat stroke episodes and IHD (log-rank p<.001) was found in a univariate cox regression analysis. After multivariate adjustment, age, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, stroke), and lower insurance premiums were associated with IHD events in patients who had a heat stroke. IHD was independently associated with heat stroke following cox multivariate regression analysis and patients with a heat stroke episode had a higher incidence of IHD events compared to those without any heat stroke episode (2598.41/10<sup>5</sup> person-years vs. 1286.14/10<sup>5</sup> person-years, adjusted hazard ratio 3.527, 95% CI: 2.078-4.032, p<.001). The onset of IHD in patients who suffered a heat stroke was earlier than in those without a heat stroke episode (2.08+/-3.45 vs. 3.61+/-3.25years, p<.001).

Occupational HR-AKI has been reported in agriculture and a few other sectors, but there has been no comprehensive study of HR-AKI across indoor and outdoor industries. Objectives To enumerate and characterize HR-AKI cases among U.S. workers in a range of industries. Methods Two data sources were analyzed: (1) archived case files of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency Management's Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing from 2010 through 2020, and (2) the Severe Injury Reports database of work-related hospitalizations that employers reported to OSHA as required by regulation from 2015 to 2020. Confirmed cases of HR-AKI were ascertained by serum creatinine measurements. When creatinine measurements were unavailable, probable and possible cases of HR-AKI were ascertained from narrative incident descriptions. Industry-specific incidence rates of HR-AKI were computed. Capture-recapture methods assessed underreporting. Results There were 607 cases of HR-AKI, including 22 confirmed cases and 585 probable or possible cases. HR-AKI occurred in a variety of indoor and outdoor industries including manufacturing, construction, mail and package delivery, and solid waste collection. Among the confirmed cases, 95.2% were male, 50.0% had hypertension, and 40.9% were newly hired workers. Incidence rates from 1.0 to 2.5 HR-AKI hospi-talizations per 100,000 workers per year were observed in high-risk industries. The capture-recapture analysis suggested that employers accurately reported only 41.2% of eligible HR-AKI hospitalizations. Conclusions Workers experienced HR-AKI in a diverse range of industries, including indoor facilities. Because of underreporting, data on work-related hospitalizations likely underestimate the true burden of occupational HR-AKI. Clinicians should be aware of kidney risk from recurrent heat stress. Employers should provide interventions to prevent kidney injury in heat-exposed workers.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.54,creatinine;acute kidney failure;adult;conference abstract;controlled study;creatinine blood level;employer;female;heat stress;hospitalization;human;human tissue;hypertension;incidence;major clinical study;male;narrative;nursing;occupational medicine;occupational safety;prevention;solid waste;worker;Kidney;Hot Temperature;Acute Kidney Injury,,

We assessed characteristics of the workers, employers, and events. We stratified cases by severity to assess whether risk factors were more prevalent in fatal HRIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 38 investigations involving 66 HRIs. Many workers had predisposing medical conditions or used predisposing medications. Comorbidities were more prevalent in workers who died. Most (73%) fatal HRIs occurred during the first week on the job. Common clinical findings in heat stroke cases included multiorgan failure, muscle breakdown, and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Severe HRI is more likely when personal susceptibilities coexist with work-related and environmental risk factors.

In this review, we aim to (1) identify pediatric morbidity outcomes previously associated with extreme heat, (2) to identify predisposing co-morbidities which may make children more susceptible to heat-related outcomes, and (3) to map the current body of available literature. A scoping review of the current full-text literature was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework Int J Soc Res Methodol 8:19-32, (2015). Search terms for (1) pediatric population, (2) heat exposures, (3) ambient conditions, and (4) adverse outcomes were combined into a comprehensive PubMed and Medline literature search.

Most identified studies supported positive associations between high extreme temperature exposures and heat-related illness, dehydration/electrolyte imbalance, general symptoms, diarrhea and digestion disorders, infectious diseases/infections, asthma/wheeze, and injury. Most studies found no association with renal disease, cardiovascular diseases, or diabetes mellitus. Results were mixed for other respiratory diseases and mental health/psychological disorders. Very few of the identified studies examined susceptibility to pre-existing conditions; Cystic Fibrosis was the only co-morbidity for which we found significant evidence.

RESULTS: 68 papers that included mortality data for elderly after heat waves were identified. The 13 of them which presented results distinguished by sex and age group were included in the review. Eight studies showed worse health outcome for elderly women compared to men. One study showed higher mortality rates for men, two found no sex differences and two studies presented inconsistent results. CONCLUSION: Studies that present sex-stratified data on mortality after heat waves seem to indicate that elderly women are at higher risk than men. Future research is warranted to validate this finding. Furthermore, a better understanding on the underlying physiological or social mechanisms for possible sex and gender differences in excessive deaths for this vulnerable population is needed to set up appropriate policy measures.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1007/s00420-018-1360-1,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;*Extreme Heat/ae [Adverse Effects];Female;Humans;Male;*Mortality;*Sex Factors;Sex Characteristics;Hot Temperature",,

OBJECTIVE: To provide a substantive overview of the research literature pertaining to biometeorological effects on children. Key information areas within urban environmental health research related to atmospheric variables (heat, air pollution, radiation) are assessed and integrated to better understand health outcomes and vulnerabilities in children. Critical avenues for improvement and understanding of children's health related to such biophysical parameters are also identified. METHODS: This comprehensive review assesses past and current primary studies, organizational reports, educational books, and review articles. Emphasis is placed on the differential ambient exposures to temperature, air pollution, and radiation within urban microclimates commonly used by children (e.g., schoolyards, urban parks), and the resulting health impacts. DISCUSSION: Exposure to heat, air pollution, and radiation are often enhanced in urban areas, specifically under the current design of the majority of outdoor child play places. Many heat indices, energy budget models, and health outcome studies fail to adequately parameterize children, yet those that do find enhanced vulnerability to ambient stressors, particularly heat and air pollution. Such environmental exposures relate strongly to behavior, activity, asthma, obesity, and overall child well-being. Current research indicates that a changing climate, growing urban population, and unsustainable design are projected to pose increasing complications. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based research to link children's health, physiology, and behavior to atmospheric extremes is an important future research avenue, underscoring the fact that children are among the population groups disproportionately affected by ambient extremes. However, current methods and population-based models lack child-specific inputs and outputs, as well as designated thresholds for accurate predictions of child health impacts. More substantive evidence is needed for applicable child-specific policies and guidelines.","Vanos, Jennifer K     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Review     Netherlands     2014/12/17     Environ Int. 2015 Mar;76:1-15. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2014.11.016.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the association between heat stress and manual labor and the risk of kidney injury among Uddanam workers METHODS: We randomly chose 676 workers from 16-indoor and outdoor occupations in 67-villages of Srikakulam district. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT°C) analyzed environmental heat exposures and categorized workers as exposed or unexposed based on heat exposures and job category. A validated questionnaire elicited self-reported heat-related illnesses (HRIs). We quantified pre- and post-shift Heat Strain Indicators (HSI) and calculated the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the creatinine-based CKD-EPI formula. We repeated measurements in a subset of workers to evaluate cross-seasonal HSI and renal function fluctuations. RESULTS: Summer WBGT was 31.7 ± 2.3°C and winter, 25.5 ± 2.5°C. 100% of workers exceeded Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) in summer and 16% in winter.

The majority of such research to date for the UK has been conducted on populations in England, whilst the impacts of ambient temperature on health outcomes in Scottish populations remain largely unknown. Methods This study uses time-series regression analysis with distributed lag non-linear models to characterise acute relationships between daily mean ambient temperature and mortality in Scotland including the four largest cities (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) and three regions during 1974-2018. Increases in mortality risk under extreme cold and heat in individual cities and regions were aggregated using multivariate meta-analysis. Cold results are summarised by comparing the relative risk (RR) of death at the 1(st) percentile of localised temperature distributions compared to the 10(th) percentile, and heat effects as the RR at the 99(th) compared to the 90(th) percentile. Results Adverse cold effects were observed in all cities and regions, and heat effects were apparent in all cities and regions except northern Scotland. Aggregate all-cause mortality risk in Scotland was estimated to increase by 10% (95% confidence interval, CI: 7%, 13%) under extreme cold and 4% (CI: 2%, 5%) under extreme heat. People in urban areas experienced higher mortality risk under extreme cold and heat than those in rural regions. The elderly had the highest RR under both extreme cold and heat. Males experienced greater cold effects than females, whereas the reverse was true with heat effects, particularly among the elderly. Those who were unmarried had higher RR than those married under extreme heat, and the effect remained after controlling for age. The younger population living in the most deprived areas experienced higher cold and heat effects than in less deprived areas. Deaths from respiratory diseases were most sensitive to both cold and heat exposures, although mortality risk for cardiovascular diseases was also heightened, particularly in the elderly. Cold effects were lower in the most recent 15 years, which may be linked to policies and actions in preventing the vulnerable population from cold impacts. No temporal trend was found with the heat effect.

However, understanding the relationship between heat-vulnerable chronic diseases and heatwaves remains incomplete due to the complexity of such a relationship mingling with human society, urban and natural environments. Our study extends the Social Ecological Theory by constructing a tri-environmental conceptual framework (i.e., across social, built, and natural environments) and contributes to the first nationwide study of the relationship between heat-vulnerable chronic diseases and heatwaves in Australia. We utilize the random forest regression model to explore the importance of heatwaves and 48 tri-environmental variables that contribute to the prevalence of six types of heat-vulnerable diseases. We further apply the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and the accumulated local effects analysis to interpret how the heat-disease nexus is mediated through tri-environments and varied across urban and rural space. The overall effect of heatwaves on diseases varies across disease types and geographical contexts (latitudes; inland versus coast). The local heat-disease nexus follows a J-shape function-becoming sharply positive after a certain threshold of heatwaves-reflecting that people with the onset of different diseases have various sensitivity and tolerance to heatwaves. However, such effects are relatively marginal compared to tri-environmental variables. We propose a number of policy implications on reducing urban-rural disparity in healthcare access and service distribution, delineating areas, and identifying the variations of sensitivity to heatwaves across urban/rural space and disease types. Our conceptual framework can be further applied to examine the relationship between other environmental problems and health outcomes.","Wang, Siqin     Cai, Wenhui     Tao, Yaguang     Sun, Qian Chayn     Wong, Paulina Pui Yun     Thongking, Witchuda     Huang, Xiao     eng     England     2022/11/08     J Environ Manage. 2023 Jan 1;325(Pt B):116663. doi: 10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116663.

STUDY DESIGN: An ecological design was used to explore the effect of ambient temperature on hospital admissions for schizophrenia. METHODS: Daily data on hospital admissions for schizophrenia and meteorological data for the warm season (May-October) in 2005-2014 were obtained from Anhui Mental Health Centre and Hefei Bureau of Meteorology, respectively. Poisson generalised linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to analyse the effects of temperature on admissions for schizophrenia. Stratified analyses according to individual characteristics, such as age and sex, were also conducted. RESULTS: A significant relationship was found between ambient temperature and admissions for schizophrenia. High temperature appeared to have a delayed effect on admissions for schizophrenia, and a temperature of 28degreeC (75th percentile) at lag 0-4 days was associated with a 7% (95% confidence interval: 4-11%) increase in admissions for schizophrenia. Stratified analyses showed that male patients, patients aged 21-60 years and married patients were more vulnerable to high temperature, and the temperature effects for those groups occurred at a lag of 1 day. CONCLUSION: High temperature poses significant risks for schizophrenia in subtropical regions. Future preventive measures for reducing the occurrence of schizophrenia should be considered for susceptible populations.","Wang, S     Zhang, X     Xie, M     Zhao, D     Zhang, H     Zhang, Y     Cheng, Q     Bai, L     Su, H     eng     Netherlands     2018/03/24     Public Health. 2018 Jun;159:70-77. doi: 10.1016/j.puhe.2018.01.032.

However, their impact on people living in tropical/subtropical regions remains largely unknown. This study assessed the impact of heatwaves on mortality and emergency hospital admissions (EHAs) from non-external causes (NEC) in Brisbane, a subtropical city in Australia. METHODS: We acquired daily data on weather, air pollution and EHAs for patients aged 15 years and over in Brisbane between January 1996 and December 2005, and on mortality between January 1996 and November 2004. A locally derived definition of heatwave (daily maximum >=37degreeC for 2 or more consecutive days) was adopted. Case-crossover analyses were used to assess the impact of heatwaves on cause-specific mortality and EHAs. RESULTS: During heatwaves, there was a statistically significant increase in NEC mortality (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.77), cardiovascular mortality (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.48), diabetes mortality in those aged 75+ (OR 9.96; 95% CI 1.02 to 96.85), NEC EHAs (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.23) and EHAs from renal diseases (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83). The elderly were found to be particularly vulnerable to heatwaves (eg, for NEC EHAs, OR 1.24 for 65-74-year-olds and 1.39 for those aged 75+). CONCLUSIONS: Significant increases in NEC mortality and EHAs were observed during heatwaves in Brisbane where people are well accustomed to hot summer weather.

We also examined the added effects of moderate heat waves (AT above the 90th percentile lasting 2-6 days), severe heat waves (AT above the 95th percentile lasting 2-6 days) and extreme heat waves (AT above the 99th percentile lasting 2-6 days). In sensitivity analysis, we tested robustness of our results to 1) different temperature and lag structures and 2) temperature metrics (daily min, max and diurnal temperature range). Results: The relative risks of moderate heat, relative to 29.2°C (75th percentile of AT), on admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and heat-related diseases (HD) were 0.98 (0.67, 1.44), 6.28 (1.48, 26.6), 1.38 (0.81, 2.36) and 1.73 (0.58, 5.11).

This study aims to identify optimal temperatures index associated with all-cause mortality and morbidity in the subtropical island of Taiwan. Methods. Climate conditions and air pollutants in the warm season (May to October) of 2000-2008 were evaluated for associations with daily death counts and outpatient visits. Eight heat indices, including single temperature measurements (average, maximum and minimum temperature) and composite heat indices (heat index, humidex, temperature humidity index, apparent temperature (AT) and wet-bulb globe temperature), were used to evaluate the effects of high temperatures on mortality and morbidity. The cumulative 8-day (lag 0-7 days) relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for heat indices and their standardized values were tested for associations with all-cause mortality and morbidity using distributed lag non-linear model. Results. The associations between temperature and all-cause mortality and outpatient visits varied with study areas, health outcomes and heat indices. AT was the best predictor of all-cause mortality. Maximum temperature consistently showed a high correlation with all-cause outpatient visits. Cumulative RRs were greater for mortality than for outpatient visits.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether exposure to relatively low or high temperature during pregnancy is associated with increasing risk of preterm birth or not. METHOD: We analysed the data of a birth cohort with 1,281,859 singleton pregnancies during 2013-2014 and matched the home address of each pregnant women to the model based daily meteorological and air pollution data. Then we used the Cox proportional hazard regression models with random effect to estimate the non-linear associations between exposure to relatively low or high temperature at each trimester of pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth, after controlling for air pollution and individual-level covariates. FINDING: The overall preterm birth rate was 8.1% (104,493 preterm births). Exposure to relatively low or high temperatures during the entire pregnancy significantly increase the risk of preterm birth, with hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of 1.03 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.04) for relatively low (9.1 , the 5th percentile) temperature and 1.55 (95%CI: 1.48, 1.61) for relatively high (23.0 , the 95th percentile) temperature in comparison with the thresholds (12.0 ). Pregnant women at the early pregnancy (the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester) are more susceptible to high temperatures while pregnant women at the late pregnancy (the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester) are more susceptible to low temperatures. CONCLUSION: These findings provide new evidence that exposure to relatively low or high temperatures during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth, which can serve as scientific evidence for prevention of preterm birth.","Wang, Yuan-Yuan     Li, Qin     Guo, Yuming     Zhou, Hong     Wang, Qiao-Mei     Shen, Hai-Ping     Zhang, Yi-Ping     Yan, Dong-Hai     Li, Shanshan     Chen, Gongbo     Zhou, Shuang     He, Yuan     Yang, Ying     Peng, Zuo-Qi     Wang, Hai-Jun     Ma, Xu     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2020/06/26     Environ Int. 2020 Sep;142:105851. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2020.105851.

We also conducted separate analyses for 1987-2002 and 2003-2017 to evaluate temporal heterogeneity. FINDINGS: The model with maximum and minimum temperatures and without heat wave indicator gave the best performance. With this model, we found a substantial and significant increase in mortality rate starting from maximum temperature at 42 degreeC and from minimum temperature at 28 degreeC: 1 degreeC increase in maximum and minimum temperatures at lag 0 were associated with 9.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.64%, 12.56%) and 9.82% (95% CI: 6.33%, 13.42%) increase in mortality risk, respectively. People aged >=65 years and lived in South residential zone where most slums were located, were more vulnerable. We observed flatter increases in mortality risk associated with high temperatures comparing the period of 2003-2017 to 1987-2002. INTERPRETATION: The analyses provided better understanding of the relationship of high temperatures with mortality in underdeveloped tropical regions and important implications in developing heat warning system for local government. The proposed CV approaches will benefit future scientific work.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111232,Forecasting;*Hot Temperature;Humans;Humidity;*Mortality;Seasons;Temperature,,

The Perceived Temperature (PT) is an equivalent temperature based on a complete heat budget model of the human body. We aimed to analyze the effect of PT on the overall mortality among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: A total of 32,870 patients with CKD living in Seoul metropolitan region were recruited in a retrospective cohort (2001-2018). PT during summer season (from July to September, at each year) was calculated using various climate factors including air temperature nearby automated weather station, dew point temperature, wind velocity, height of anemometer above ground, and total cloud amount. We assessed the association of PT using inverse distance weighting (IDW) on mortality in CKD patients in the Cox proportional hazard model that was adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, eGFR, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

Exertional heat illness (EHI) remains a persistent problem for athletes and individuals. This threat remains despite numerous athletic position statements and occupational guidance policies. This review explores primary evidence that demonstrates a direct association between 'known' risk factors and EHI. What advances does it highlight? Primary evidence to support 'known' risk factors associated with EHI is not comprehensive. Furthermore, it is not evident that single individual factors predispose individuals to greater risk. In fact, the evidence indicates that EHI can manifest in non-hostile compensable environments when a combination of risk factors is prevalent. ABSTRACT: Despite the widespread knowledge of exertional heat illness (EHI) and clear guidance for its prevention, the incidence of EHI remains high. We carried out a systematic review of available literature evaluating the scientific evidence underpinning the risk factors associated with EHI. Medline, PsycINFO, SportDiscus and Embase were searched from inception to January 2019 with no date limitation, with supplementary searches also being performed. Search terms included permutations of risk and heat illness, with only studies in English included. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, using the QUALSYST tool, were performed by two independent reviewers. Of 8898 articles identified by the searches, 42 were included in the systematic review as primary evidence demonstrating a link between a risk factor and EHI. The quality scores ranged from 57.50 to 100%, and studies were generally considered to be of strong quality. The majority of risks attributable to EHI were categorized as those associated with lifestyle factors. The findings from the systematic review suggest complex manifestation of EHI through multiple risk factors rather than any one factor in isolation. Further research is needed to explore the accumulation of risk factors to help in development of effective preventative measures.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Anne,10.1113/EP088458,Athletes;*Heat Stress Disorders/ep [Epidemiology];*Heat Stress Disorders/pp [Physiopathology];*Hot Temperature;Humans;Incidence;Risk Factors;*Sports/ph [Physiology],,

Methods: We examined the average maximum temperature, relative humidity, and daily paediatric emergency department visits in June through August of 2002 to 2019. We reviewed emergency department visits from two academic hospitals. Daily meteorological data from the local weather station were obtained from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Results: Extreme heat, defined as the 99th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution, occurred at 33.1 degrees C and was associated with an overall 22% increase in emergency department visits, compared to the reference temperature of 21 degrees C. This association was mostly found between the second and fifth day after the exposure, suggesting a slightly delayed effect. The results of the sub-group analysis indicate that the risk of an emergency department visit due to infectious disease increases by 35% and the most pronounced association was noted in children aged 1 to 12 years.

The city of Perth, Western Australia, frequently experiences hot summer conditions, with recent summers showing above average temperatures. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures, mortality, emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions data were acquired for Perth for the period 1994 to 2008. Using an observed/expected analysis, the temperature thresholds for mortality were estimated at 34-36 degrees C (maximum) and 20 degrees C (minimum). Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were used to estimate the percentage increase in mortality and morbidity outcomes with a 10 degrees C increment in temperature, with adjustment for air pollutants. Effect estimates are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). The health impact of heatwave days (three or more days of >= 35 degrees C) was also investigated. A 9.8% increase in daily mortality (IRR 1.098; 95%CI: 1.007-1.196) was associated with a 10 C increase in maximum temperature above threshold. Total ED presentations increased by 4.4% (IRR 1.044; 95%CI: 1.033-1.054) and renal-related ED presentations by 10.2% (IRR 1.102; 95%CI: 1.071-1.135) per 10 degrees C increase in maximum temperature. Heatwave days were associated with increases in daily mortality and ED presentations, while total hospital admissions were decreased on heatwave days. Public health interventions will be increasingly important to minimise the adverse health impacts of hot weather in Perth, particularly if the recent trend of rising average temperatures and more hot days continues as projected.

While several studies have shown an increased risk of exacerbation during cold winter months, heat-related exacerbations are less well studied. Aims and Objectives: With climate change scenarios predicting a higher frequency and duration of heat waves, we aimed to identify patient groups most at risk for heatrelated exacerbations. It was our goal to determine at which temperature threshold daily hospital admissions due to acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) increase during the summer in Berlin. Methods: We analyzed retrospective demographic and medical data from 1, 191 patients, who were hospitalized for AECOPD in the metropolitan area of Berlin, Germany. Climate data were available from the Deutscher Wetterdienst. Results: Patients with COPD exacerbations during hot summer periods had more often a history of myocardial infarction (P = 0.014). An AECOPD during colder summers happened to patients with a higher Charlson index, who suffered in increased numbers of peripheral vascular diseases (P = 0.016) or tumors (P = 0.004). In hot summers, more active smokers developed an AECOPD than former smokers (P = 0.011). A Poisson regression analysis revealed an increase of hospital admissions per day if the daily minimum temperature increased above 18.3°C (P = 0.006). Conclusions: Our results indicate that active smoking and a past myocardial infarction status induce more vulnerability to urban heat stress in COPD. If minimum outdoor temperatures in Berlin increase above 18.3°C, COPD patients should consider heat protection to prevent heat stress.",Suppl. 62     Hh2rv     Pa5079     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 | RAYYAN-LABELS: new,10.1183/13993003.congress-2018.PA5079,"adult;Charlson Comorbidity Index;chronic obstructive lung disease;climate change;conference abstract;controlled study;disease exacerbation;ex-smoker;female;Germany;heart infarction;heat stress;hospital admission;human;major clinical study;male;neoplasm;prevention;regression analysis;retrospective study;risk assessment;summer;Myocardial Infarction;Hot Temperature;Smoke;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,

METHODS: The authors used spatial regression models to measure the relationships between the spatial characteristics of temperature, extracted factors from demographic and socio-economic parameters, and the mean cardiovascular mortality 2 weeks before and after cold or heat events from 1994 to 2003. RESULTS: Metropolitan regions were found to have a substantially lower mortality than rural areas after cold and heat events. Events of cold, compared with heat, had greater impacts on the mortality ratio in most townships. A negative association was identified, using a spatial lag model, between the mortality after cold and heat events and urbanisation, and the availability of medical resources. A higher percentage of older people, vulnerable and aborigines might have contributed to the increasing vulnerability of townships during cold and heat events. CONCLUSIONS: These data, using an island-wide spatial analysis, suggest that urban areas have a greater adaptive capability than rural areas, plausibly because people in urban areas have a higher socio-economic status and more medical resources. Social inequality across urban and rural townships is apparent and developing customised adaptation programmes for vulnerable regions to cope with heat and cold event should be prioritised.","Wu, Pei-Chih     Lin, Chuan-Yao     Lung, Shih-Chun     Guo, How-Ran     Chou, Chang-Hung     Su, Huey-Jen     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     2010/11/03     Occup Environ Med. 2011 Jul;68(7):525-30. doi: 10.1136/oem.2010.056168.

Respiratory diseases are associated with a large disease burden. Heatwaves and cold spells, the two most common extreme weather events, have been shown to have crucial negative effects on the prevalence of respiratory diseases. However, impacts of extreme weather on the prevalence of respiratory diseases has been largely overlooked in western China, where more intense and frequent extreme temperature events have been occurring over the past decades. This research gap will obtain an attribution bias in the effects of extreme weather events on the prevalence of respiratory diseases. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the impact of heatwaves and cold spells on the morbidity of respiratory diseases using a distributed lag nonlinear model with daily disease cases from 2013 to 2016 in Lanzhou, one of the largest cities in western China. A reverse U-shaped relationship depicted the relationship between temperature and the morbidity of respiratory diseases. The highest relative risk was found at 2.6 degrees C by 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.21). Furthermore, we found a significant decrease in the relative risk for heatwaves and a significant increase in the relative risk of cold spells when the temperature exceeded the corresponding threshold by 1 degrees C. Heatwaves and cold spells play harvest effects on the morbidity of respiratory diseases. Our study suggest that the relative risk of respiratory diseases will increase as the climate warms in the future, and thus a preventive system is needed for individuals and medical policy-makers.",Kr9vo     Times Cited:7     Cited References Count:51 | RAYYAN-LABELS: new,10.1016/j.pce.2019.102825,Extreme temperatures;Harvesting effect;Environmental medicine;Climatic change;HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY;CLIMATE-CHANGE;TIME-SERIES;AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE;HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS;AIR-POLLUTION;GLOBAL BURDEN;WEATHER;VISITS;WAVES;Cold Temperature;China,,

However, few data are available on the risk assessment of the potential reasons for HFMD in Beijing. This study examined the association of temperature with the incidence of children's HFMD in Beijing at the daily scale for the first time. Methods A newly developed case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to assess the delayed and cumulative associations of daily temperature with gender- and age-specific HFMD in Beijing, China, during 2010-2012. Relative humidity, day of the week, public holiday, season and long-term trends were controlled in the model. Results Among the total of 113,475 cases, the ratio between males and females was 1.52:1. HFMD was more prevalent in May-July. The temperature-HFMD relationships were non-linear in most age groups except for children aged 6-15 years, with a peak at 25.0 similar to 27.5 degrees C. The high-temperature risks were greater, appeared earlier and lasted longer than the low-temperature risks. The relative risks for female children and those aged 6-15 years were higher than those among other groups.

However, little is known about socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat. We aimed to evaluate whether there were socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat-related all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization among Brazilian cities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected daily hospitalization and weather data in the hot season (city-specific 4 adjacent hottest months each year) during 2000-2015 from 1,814 Brazilian cities covering 78.4% of the Brazilian population. A time-stratified case-crossover design modeled by quasi-Poisson regression and a distributed lag model was used to estimate city-specific heat-hospitalization association. Then meta-analysis was used to synthesize city-specific estimates according to different socioeconomic quartiles or levels. We included 49 million hospitalizations (58.5% female; median [interquartile range] age: 33.3 [19.8-55.7] years). For cities of lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI), and high income (HI) according to the World Bank's classification, every 5degreeC increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 4.4%-5.7%, P < 0.001), 3.7% (3.3%-4.0%, P < 0.001), and 2.6% (1.7%-3.4%, P < 0.001) increase in all-cause hospitalization, respectively. The inter-city socioeconomic disparities in the association were strongest for children and adolescents (0-19 years) (increased all-cause hospitalization risk with every 5degreeC increase [95% CI]: 9.9% [8.7%-11.1%], P < 0.001, in LMI cities versus 5.2% [4.1%-6.3%], P < 0.001, in HI cities). The disparities were particularly evident for hospitalization due to certain diseases, including ischemic heart disease (increase in cause-specific hospitalization risk with every 5degreeC increase [95% CI]: 5.6% [-0.2% to 11.8%], P = 0.060, in LMI cities versus 0.5% [-2.1% to 3.1%], P = 0.717, in HI cities), asthma (3.7% [0.3%-7.1%], P = 0.031, versus -6.4% [-12.1% to -0.3%], P = 0.041), pneumonia (8.0% [5.6%-10.4%], P < 0.001, versus 3.8% [1.1%-6.5%], P = 0.005), renal diseases (9.6% [6.2%-13.1%], P < 0.001, versus 4.9% [1.8%-8.0%], P = 0.002), mental health conditions (17.2% [8.4%-26.8%], P < 0.001, versus 5.5% [-1.4% to 13.0%], P = 0.121), and neoplasms (3.1% [0.7%-5.5%], P = 0.011, versus -0.1% [-2.1% to 2.0%], P = 0.939). The disparities were similar when stratifying the cities by other socioeconomic indicators (urbanization rate, literacy rate, and household income). The main limitations were lack of data on personal exposure to temperature, and that our city-level analysis did not assess intra-city or individual-level socioeconomic disparities and could not exclude confounding effects of some unmeasured variables. CONCLUSIONS: Less developed cities displayed stronger associations between heat exposure and all-cause hospitalizations and certain types of cause-specific hospitalizations in Brazil.

Whether temperature rise could affect undernutrition directly is unknown. We aim to quantify the relationship between short-term heat exposure and risk of hospitalization due to undernutrition in Brazil. Methods and findings We collected hospitalization and weather data for the hot season (the 4 adjacent hottest months for each city) from 1,814 Brazilian cities during 1 January 2000-31 December 2015. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to quantify the association between heat exposure and hospitalization due to undernutrition. Region-specific odds ratios (ORs) were used to calculate the attributable fractions (AFs). A total of 238,320 hospitalizations for undernutrition were recorded during the 2000-2015 hot seasons. Every 1 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature was associated with a 2.5% (OR 1.025, 95% CI 1.020-1.030, p < 0.001) increase in hospitalizations for undernutrition across lag 0-7 days. The association was greatest for individuals aged >= 80 years (OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.034-1.059, p < 0.001), 0-4 years (OR 1.039, 95% CI 1.024-1.055, p < 0.001), and 5-19 years (OR 1.042, 95% CI 1.015-1.069, p = 0.002). Assuming a causal relationship, we estimate that 15.6% of undernutrition hospitalizations could be attributed to heat exposure during the study period. The AF grew from 14.1% to 17.5% with a 1.1 degrees C increase in mean temperature from 2000 to 2015. The main limitations of this study are misclassification of different types of undernutrition, lack of individual temperature exposure data, and being unable to adjust for relative humidity. Conclusions Our study suggests that global warming might directly increase undernutrition morbidity, by a route other than by threatening food security. This short-term effect is increasingly important with global warming. Global strategies addressing the syndemic of climate change and undernutrition should focus not only on food systems, but also on the prevention of heat exposure. Author summaryWhy was this study done? It has been well documented that global warming will indirectly result in more undernourished people by threatening crop production in the long term. However, no study has yet evaluated the short-term and direct effect of heat exposure on morbidity related to undernutrition. What did the researchers do and find? With daily hospitalization data covering nearly 80% of the Brazilian population during 2000-2015, we used a time-stratified case-crossover design to quantify the association between heat exposure and hospitalization for undernutrition. We also estimated the heat-related hospitalization burden. There was a 2.5% increase in undernutrition hospitalizations following every 1 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season. The young (0-19 years) and elderly people (>= 80 years) with undernutrition were more vulnerable to heat exposure than other age groups. Heat exposure was responsible for 15.6% of the undernutrition hospitalizations during the study period, corresponding to 37,129 cases. The attributable fraction increased from 14.1% in 2000 to 17.5% in 2015, paralleling a 1.1 degrees C increase in average temperature. What do these findings mean? Rising temperature might impact undernutrition morbidity directly and more rapidly than through threatening food security alone. The possible pathways of this direct impact of heat might include reducing undernourished people's food intake, impairing their digestion and absorption function, and causing fluid and electrolyte disturbances. This direct, short-term effect will be increasingly important with global warming, as illustrated by what happened in Brazil over 2000-2015. Global strategies addressing the syndemic of climate change and undernutrition should focus not only on food systems, but also on the prevention of heat exposure, especially among the young and elderly.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002950,REFERENT SELECTION-STRATEGIES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;AIR-POLLUTION;QUANTIFY;IMPACTS;DISEASE;MODELS;Hot Temperature;Cross-Over Studies;Brazil,,

However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4% (using ""mean temperatures >=95th percentile for >=2days"" as a heatwave definition), 3% (mean temperatures >=98th percentile for >=2days), 7% (mean temperatures >=99th percentile for >=2days) and 16% (mean temperatures >=97th percentile for >=5days). Heatwave intensity plays a relatively more important role than duration in determining heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with the definition of heatwaves.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between heatwaves and cause-specific emergency department visits (EDVs) across eight communities in both urban and rural regions throughout Queensland, Australia. METHODS: Daily data on EDVs, air pollution and climatic conditions during the 1st January 2013 to the 31st December 2015 were obtained from relevant government agencies. Heatwave was defined as >=95th percentile of the mean temperature for three or more consecutive days in each community. A quasi-Poisson generalized additive model with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to assess the heatwave impacts on EDVs. Random effect meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effects of heatwaves on cause-specific EDVs across the urban and rural regions as well as the whole Queensland. The causes of EDVs investigated in this study were infectious and parasitic diseases (ICD code: A00-B99), endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-E90), mental and behavioural disorders (F00-F99), diseases of the nervous system (G00-G99), diseases of the ear and mastoid process (H60-H95), diseases of the circulatory system (I00-I99), diseases of the respiratory system (J00-J99), diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00-L99), diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00-M99), diseases of the genitourinary system (N00-N99), and injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (S00-T98). RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that there were significant effects of heatwaves on total EDVs and a wide-spectrum of cause-specific EDVs. For example, EDVs for endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34), diseases of the nervous system (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17), and diseases of the genitourinary system (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09) increased substantially during heatwave days. The effect of heatwaves on total EDVs was similar for rural (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07) and urban regions (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.07).

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between extreme temperatures and paediatric emergency department admissions (EDAs) in Brisbane, Australia, during 2003-2009. METHODS: A quasi-Poisson generalised linear model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the relationships between extreme temperatures and age-, gender- and cause-specific paediatric EDAs, while controlling for air pollution, relative humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemics, public holiday, season and long-term trends. The model residuals were checked to identify whether there was an added effect due to heat waves or cold spells. RESULTS: There were 131 249 EDAs among children during the study period. Both high (RR=1.27; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.44) and low (RR=1.81; 95% CI 1.66 to 1.97) temperatures were significantly associated with an increase in paediatric EDAs in Brisbane. Male children were more vulnerable to temperature effects. Children aged 0-4 years were more vulnerable to heat effects and children aged 10-14 years were more sensitive to both hot and cold effects. High temperatures had a significant impact on several paediatric diseases, including intestinal infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, nervous system diseases and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Low temperatures were significantly associated with intestinal infectious diseases, respiratory diseases and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases.

This study aimed to examine a very short-term effect of heat on the risk of acute kidney injury at an hourly level and assessed potential modification effects by age, gender and preexisting diseases. METHODS: We performed a time-stratified case-crossover design with a conditional logistic regression model to examine the association between hourly temperature and hourly emergency department visits for acute kidney injury (N = 1815) in Queensland state of Australia, 2013-2015. Heat effect on acute kidney injury was reported for temperature increases from 50th percentile (26.1 degreeC) to 95th percentile (33.6 degreeC). RESULTS: The effect of heat on acute kidney injury occurred in the same hour of heat exposure (odds ratio (OR): 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 1.71), with no temperature threshold observed. Males (OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.85, 3.32) and those aged >64 years (OR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.01, 4.27), particularly those with pre-existing diabetes (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.91, 3.30), hypertension (OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.61, 3.15), heart failure (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.72, 2.84), or chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.89, 3.55), were at great risks of acute kidney injury attack after exposure to heat. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners and specialists should remind their patients about this risk in summer. Tailored heat adaptation strategies protecting adults working outdoors are urgently needed, especially within the context of climate change.","Xu, Zhiwei     Hu, Xinxin     Tong, Shilu     Cheng, Jian     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2019/12/24     Environ Res. 2020 Mar;182:109058. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2019.109058.

METHODS: An ecological design was used in this study. A Poisson linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to quantify the effect of temperature on EDAs for asthma among children aged 0-14 years in Brisbane, Australia, during January 2003-December 2009, while controlling for air pollution, relative humidity, day of the week, season and long-term trends. The model residuals were checked to identify whether there was an added effect due to heat waves or cold spells. RESULTS: There were 13 324 EDAs for childhood asthma during the study period. Both hot and cold temperatures were associated with increases in EDAs for childhood asthma, and their effects both appeared to be acute. An added effect of heat waves on EDAs for childhood asthma was observed, but no added effect of cold spells was found. Male children and children aged 0-4 years were most vulnerable to heat effects, while children aged 10-14 years were most vulnerable to cold effects.

A systematic review was conducted to elucidate the relationship between heat waves and children's health. Literature published up to August 2012 were identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: ""heatwave"", ""heat wave"", ""child health"", ""morbidity"", ""hospital admission"", ""emergency department visit"", ""family practice"", ""primary health care"", ""death"" and ""mortality"". Of the 628 publications identified, 12 met the selection criteria. The existing literature does not consistently suggest that mortality among children increases significantly during heat waves, even though infants were associated with more heat-related deaths. Exposure to heat waves in the perinatal period may pose a threat to children's health. Pediatric diseases or conditions associated with heat waves include renal disease, respiratory disease, electrolyte imbalance and fever. Future research should focus on how to develop a consistent definition of a heat wave from a children's health perspective, identifying the best measure of children's exposure to heat waves, exploring sensitive outcome measures to quantify the impact of heat waves on children, evaluating the possible impacts of heat waves on children's birth outcomes, and understanding the differences in vulnerability to heat waves among children of different ages and from different income countries.

This study aimed to assess the effects of heatwaves on hospitalizations and post-discharge deaths for diabetes, and to identify the individual- and community-level characteristics [i.e. age, gender, Socio-economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] that modified heatwave effects. METHODS: Health data were extracted from a cohort study which included patients in Brisbane, Australia, who were hospitalized due to diabetes from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2013, and died within 2 months after they were discharged. Data on community-level modifiers, including SEIFA and NDVI (i.e. urban vegetation), were obtained from Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian Bureau of Meteorology, respectively. Case-crossover design was used to quantify the effects of heatwaves on hospitalizations and post-discharge deaths due to diabetes. Four heatwave definitions incorporating both intensity (i.e. 90th, 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles of mean temperature distribution) and duration (2 days), as well as excess heat factor (EHF), were used. A case-only design was adopted to identify the modifiers of heatwave effects. RESULTS: There were 10 542 hospitalizations for diabetes, and 513 patients died due to diabetes within 2 months after discharge. During low-intensity heatwave days (i.e. 90th percentile & 2 days), we did not observe a significant increase in hospitalizations for diabetes [9% at lag 0; 95% confidence interval (CI): -3%, 23%; P = 0.146], but we observed a significant increase in post-discharge deaths (46% at lag 2; 95% CI: 3%, 107%; P = 0.036). During middle-intensity heatwave days (i.e. 95th percentile & 2 days), hospitalizations for diabetes increased by 19% at lag 0 (95% CI: 2%, 39%; P = 0.026), and post-discharge deaths increased by 64% at lag 0 (95% CI: 6%, 154%; P = 0.027). During high-intensity heatwave days (i.e. 97th percentile & 2 days), hospitalizations for diabetes increased by 37% at lag 1 (95% CI: 11%, 69%; P = 0.004) and post-discharge deaths increased by 137% at lag 1 (95% CI: 39%, 303%; P = 0.002). When heatwave intensity increased to 99th percentile, we did not observe a significant increase in hospitalizations (-1% at lag 0; 95% CI: -38%, 59%; P = 0.870) or post-discharge deaths (79% at lag 0; 95% CI: -39%, 431%; P = 0.301). When we used EHF to define heatwaves, we observed significant increases of hospitalizations (7%; 95% CI: 1%, 15%; P = 0.039) and post-discharge deaths (68%, 95% CI: 10%, 158%; P = 0.017) during heatwave days, compared with non-heatwave days. Children and male diabetics were particularly vulnerable to heatwave effects, but we did not find any significant modification effect of SEIFA or NDVI on the associations of heatwaves with hospitalizations and post-discharge deaths due to diabetes.

METHODS: People who were hospitalized for stroke from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2005 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2013 in Brisbane, Australia, and died from stroke within two months after discharge were included in this cohort study. The effects of extreme temperatures on hospitalizations and post-discharge deaths for stroke in patients with and without pre-existing hyperlipidemia were quantified using a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression. Suburb-level temperature data were used to minimize exposure measurement bias. Relative humidity, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were adjusted as potential confounders in the regression. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine if age, sex, and suburb-level greenspace (measured as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) and socioeconomic status (measured as Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)) modified the temperature-stroke relationship in the hyperlipidemia group and the non-hyperlipidemia group. RESULTS: There were 11,469 hospitalizations for stroke during the study period, and 2270 (19.79%) of them died within two months after discharge. Significant effect of heat on hospitalizations for stroke was observed only in individuals with pre-existing hyperlipidemia (odds ratio (OR): 1.85; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-3.19), and significant effect of cold on hospitalizations was found in individuals without pre-existing hyperlipidemia (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03-2.47). Males appeared to be more vulnerable to the effects of heat and cold on hospitalizations for stroke than females. People living in suburbs with low-level greenspace (OR: 4.23; 95% CI: 1.08-16.61) were more vulnerable to heat effect on stroke hospitalizations than those living in suburbs with high-level greenspace (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.32-6.16). People living in suburbs with the lowest socioeconomic advantage level or the lowest economic resources level were most vulnerable the effects of heat and cold on hospitalizations for stroke. No significant effect of heat or cold on post-discharge deaths from stroke was observed.

Although epidemiologic evidence is clear for elevated mortality risks of heatwaves, the economic impacts due to heatwave-associated mortality remain poorly characterized. Hence, this study systematically assessed the mortality and economic impacts of the 2017 exceptional heatwaves in China. We first used the generalized linear mixed-effect model with Poisson distribution to examine the mortality risks of the 2017 heatwaves in 91 Chinese counties. Further, we calculated the excess deaths attributable to heatwaves in 2852 counties. Finally, we evaluated the city- and province-level death-related economic burden of the 2017 heatwaves based on the value of statistical life (VSL). We found that the 2017 exceptional heatwaves had a statistically significant association (relative risk was 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.32) with all-cause mortality across 91 Chinese counties. Nationwide, a total of 16,299 all-cause deaths that occurred in 2017 were attributable to the exceptional heatwaves, resulting in an overall death-related economic loss of 61,304 million RMB as valued by VSL. Given that extraordinary heatwaves are projected to be more frequent under global climate change, our findings could enhance the current understanding of heatwaves' health and economic impacts and add valuable insights in projection studies of estimating the future health burden of heatwaves.","Yan, Meilin     Xie, Yang     Zhu, Huanhuan     Ban, Jie     Gong, Jicheng     Li, Tiantian     eng     Netherlands     2021/12/18     Sci Total Environ. 2022 Mar 15;812:152371. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152371.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected daily data on ambient temperature and CVD mortality from a central urban district in Shanghai, China, during the period from 1981 to 2012. We used overdispersed generalized additive Poisson regression together with a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate potentially lagged and nonlinear effects of temperature on CVD mortality after controlling for the seasonality, relative humidity, day of the week, holidays and population size. To allow for the evaluation of long-term variations in the effects, we divided the entire study period into six sub-periods (1981-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2012) and analyzed the effect estimates in each sub-period separately. RESULTS: The association between temperature and daily CVD mortality was J-shaped with both low and high temperatures increasing the risk of CVD deaths. The effects of extremely low temperatures were delayed and persisted for two weeks, while extreme hot effects were limited to the first five days followed by a significant mortality displacement (9days). The relative risks (RRs) of extremely low, moderately low, moderately high, and extremely high temperatures comparing the 1st, 10th, 90th, and 99th percentile with the reference temperature (26degreeC) over the cumulative lags of 0-14days were 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.84,2.07], 1.61 (95% CI: 1.57,1.66), 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01,1.05), and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.07,1.21). The RRs for extremely low and moderately low temperature attenuated substantially from 9.78 and 5.52 in 1981-1985 to 1.42 and 1.18 in 2006-2012, respectively, but the RRs remained almost stable for extremely high and moderately high temperatures.

We performed a time-series analysis to predict the risks of stillbirth and explored the associations between temperature and stillbirth with a distributed lag nonlinear model. We calculated the number of stillbirths attributable to hot and cold temperatures, which corresponded to the optimal temperature with the lowest stillbirth rate. Results and Conclusions: We analyzed 22,769 stillbirths that occurred between 2009 and 2018. The mean stillbirth rate was 1.13±0.14%. The relative risks of stillbirth due to exposure to cold (<20°C), mild heat (22-25°C), moderate heat (25-29°C), and extreme heat (>29°C) were 1.08 (95% CI 1.02, 1.14), 1.10 (95% CI 1.04, 1.17), 1.15 (95% CI 1.09, 1.22), and 1.18 (95% CI 1.11, 1.25), respectively.

Evidence suggests that the local heat loss response of skin blood flow (SkBF) is affected by diabetes-related impairments in both endothelium-dependent and non-endothelium-dependent mechanisms, resulting in lower elevations in SkBF in response to a heat or pharmacological stimulus. Thermoregulatory sweating may also be diminished by type 2 diabetes, impairing the body's ability to transfer heat from its core to the environment. Diabetes-associated co-morbidities and the medications (particularly those affecting fluid balance) required to treat these conditions may exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness by decreasing SkBF and sweating further. Unfortunately, the majority of studies measure local heat loss responses in the hands and feet and lack measures of core temperature. Therefore, the impact of these impairments on whole-body heat loss remains unknown. This review addresses heat-related vulnerability in individuals with type 2 diabetes by examining the literature related to heat loss responses in this population. Type 2 diabetes, its associated co-morbidities, and the medications required in their treatment may cause dehydration, lower SkBF, and reduced sweating, which could consequently impair thermoregulation. This effect is most evident in individuals with poor blood glucose control. Although type 2 diabetes can be associated with impairments in SkBF and sweating, more physically active individuals requiring fewer medications and having good blood glucose control may be able to tolerate heat as well as those of similar age and body composition.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.1089/dia.2012.0324,"Body Temperature Regulation;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/pp [Physiopathology];*Diabetic Neuropathies/pp [Physiopathology];*Dyslipidemias/pp [Physiopathology];Exercise;Female;Hot Temperature;Humans;*Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology];Male;Regional Blood Flow;Risk Factors;Sedentary Behavior;Skin/bs [Blood Supply];*Skin/pp [Physiopathology];*Skin Diseases/pp [Physiopathology];Sweating",,

We assessed the potential effect of hot and cold temperatures on emergency hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in Brisbane, Australia. Methods: Between 2000 and 2005, the health effects of hot and cold temperatures by linking the daily respiratory and cardiovascular emergency hospital admissions with meteorologic conditions during summer (December-February) and winter (June-August) season were estimated. We used daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures as exposure indicators. We fitted Poisson regression models with regression splines to control for humidity, ozone, PM10, and long-term trend. Day of week and holidays were also controlled as factor variables. We evaluated the effects of temperature among several age groups (0 -14, 15-64, 65-74, and 75+). Results: In summer, emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases increased monotonically with mean temperature and maximum temperature on the same day as admission, especially for the people aged >75 years, with a 1.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, 3.7%) increase for each degree above 29°C of mean temperature. There were also significant increases within a few days (lag 1-lag4) after exposure. Similar effects of mean temperature were seen for admissions for respiratory admissions; however, while the magnitude of the increase could be large, the increase was not significant. In contrast, negative but not significant effects for cardiovascular admissions were observed with mean temperature and minimum temperature in 15-64, 65-74, and 75+ year age groups in winter.

METHODS: Cross-sectional cohort study observing 63 youth football players, varying in position. Independent variables were league (weight-restricted (WR, n=27) and age-restricted (AR, n=36)) and event type. Dependent variables were anthropometrics, work-to-rest ratio, and wet bulb globe temperature. Descriptive variables included preparticipation examination and uniform configuration. A subset of 16 players participated in physiological variables (heart rate and gastrointestinal temperature). Data collection occurred on 7 AR and 8 WR nonconsecutive practices and the first 3 games of the season. RESULTS: Mean values for anthropometric variables were higher (p < 0.05) in the AR league than the WR league. Work time (chi<sup>2</sup> (1,111)=4.232; p=0.039) and rest time (chi<sup>2</sup> (1,111)=43.41; p < 0.001) were significantly greater for games, but ratios were significantly higher for practices (chi<sup>2</sup> (1,111)=40.62; p < 0.001). The majority of events (77%) observed were in black and red flag wet bulb globe temperature risk categories. A total of 57% of the players had a preparticipation examination, and up to 82% of events observed were in full uniforms. Individual gastrointestinal temperature and heart rate responses ranged widely and no players reached critical thresholds. CONCLUSION: Extrinsic (disproportionate work ratios, environmental conditions) and intrinsic (higher body mass index) EHI risk factors exist in youth football. Certain risk factors may be influenced by event and league type. National youth football organizations need to create thorough guidelines that address EHI risk factors for local leagues to adopt.","Yeargin, Susan W     Dickinson, John J     Emerson, Dawn M     Koller, Jessica     Torres-McGehee, Toni M     Kerr, Zachary Y     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     China     2021/02/02     J Sport Health Sci. 2021 Jan;10(1):91-98. doi: 10.1016/j.jshs.2019.03.002.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the added effects of heatwaves on cause-specific mortality in China. METHODS: We designed a nationwide time-series analysis based on daily data from 272 main Chinese cities to from 2013 to 2015. We adopted 12 definitions by combining 4 heat thresholds (90th, 92.5th, 95th, 97.5th percentile of city-specific daily mean temperature) and duration of >=2, 3 and 4days. We applied overdispersed generalized additive models with distributed lag models to estimate the city-specific cumulative effects of heatwaves over lags of 0-10days after controlling for daily temperature. We then, used a meta-regression model to pool the effect estimates at national and regional levels. RESULTS: Heatwaves could significantly increase risk for mortality from total and cardiopulmonary diseases, including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke (rather than hemorrhagic stroke) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The effects increased with higher thresholds, but were not appreciably influenced by the duration of heat. The risks generally occurred immediately and lasted for 3 to 5days. The risks were much larger in the temperate continental zone and the temperate monsoon zones than in the subtropical monsoon zone where there was an evident mortality displacement. The elderly, females and less-educated people were more vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provided ample evidence for the added mortality risk associated with heatwaves, which had important implications for designing heatwave-warning systems and predicting the disease burden of future heatwaves.","Yin, Peng     Chen, Renjie     Wang, Lijun     Liu, Cong     Niu, Yue     Wang, Weidong     Jiang, Yixuan     Liu, Yunning     Liu, Jiangmei     Qi, Jinlei     You, Jinling     Zhou, Maigeng     Kan, Haidong     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2018/10/23     Environ Int. 2018 Dec;121(Pt 1):898-905. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2018.10.016.

Several studies have found associations between temperature, fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and birth weight. However, the relevant timing of exposures varies between studies and is yet unclear. Therefore, we assessed the difference in term birthweight (TBW) associated with weekly exposure to temperature and PM<sub>2.5</sub> throughout 37 weeks of gestation. METHODS: We included all singleton live term births in Massachusetts, U.S between 2004 and 2015 (n = 712,438). Weekly PM<sub>2.5</sub> and temperature predictions were estimated on a 1 km grid from satellite-based models. We utilized a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to estimate the difference in TBW associated with weekly exposures from the last menstrual period to 37 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: We found a nonlinear association with prenatal temperature exposure. Larger effects were observed in warmer temperatures, where higher temperatures were negatively associated with TBW. Temperature effects were larger in the first and final weeks of gestation. We observed a negative difference in TBW associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. Overall, a 1 microg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in prenatal exposure was associated with 3.9 g lower TBW (95% CI -5.0 g; -2.9 g). PM<sub>2.5</sub> effects were larger in the final weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: We found heat and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure to be related to lower TBW. Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to both exposures towards the end of pregnancy. Susceptibility to heat was higher in the initial weeks of pregnancy as well. These critical windows of susceptibility can be communicated to pregnant women during routine prenatal visits to increase awareness and target interventions to reduce exposures.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106588,Air Pollutants/an [Analysis];Air Pollutants/to [Toxicity];*Air Pollutants;Air Pollution/an [Analysis];*Air Pollution;Birth Weight;Female;Humans;Maternal Exposure/ae [Adverse Effects];Particulate Matter/an [Analysis];Particulate Matter/to [Toxicity];Pregnancy;Temperature;0 (Air Pollutants);0 (Particulate Matter),,

The present study examined mortality from and morbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with extreme temperature and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) by sex and age in 2005–2016 in metropolitans of Taiwan. Methods: The distributed lag non-linear model was applied to analyze roles of extreme high (99th percentile) and low (5th percentile) temperatures, and 90th percentile PM2.5 and ozone (O3) in association with CKD risks of deaths, emergency room visits (ERVs), and outpatient visits by age (40–64 and 65 years and above) and sex. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all studied areas were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Cold spells (<14 °C) showed a higher risk on mortality from CKD for the elderly.

METHODS: We used Medicare data to select the susceptible populations; we then estimated modification of the risk of dying associated to extreme temperatures. To this aim we conducted a case-only analysis using cause-specific hospital admission data in 135 cities for the period 1985-2006 and selecting the subjects who died. We used distributions of daily minimum and maximum temperature in each city to define extremely hot days (≥ 99th percentile) and extremely cold days (≤ 1st percentile), respectively. As modifiers we included cause-specific hospitalizations such as atrial fibrillation, and Alzheimer disease among others, individual characteristics such as race and gender, zipcode level census variables and zipcode level percent of land with green space from the 2001 National Land Use Cover dataset. For each (hypothesized) effect modifier, a city-specific logistic regression model was fitted for both cold and hot days and an overall estimate calculated in a subsequent meta-analysis. RESULTS: Subjects with atrial fibrillation [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.08], with Alzheimer disease (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12), and non-white (OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) were more susceptible to extreme heat.

METHODS: The definition of heatwave was a period at least 3 consecutive days with maximum temperature exceeding 35degreeC in this study. A time-stratified case-crossover design was conducted to examine the relationship between heatwaves and outpatient visits for RD. Patient data for the period from 2010 to 2012 were collected from the Third People's Hospital of Cangnan and daily meteorological data for the same period were collected from the China Meteorological Data Service Center. Data regarding the air pollution index (API), a composite indicator of air pollution, were collected from the Data Center of the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. RD were identified based on the 10th revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes (J00-J99). A conditional Poisson regression model was applied to examine the heatwave-RD association using the Relative Risk (RR) while adjusting for meteorological and air pollution factors including temperature, rainfall, wind speed, pressure, humidity, sunshine hours and API. RESULTS: During the study period, 4 heatwaves occurred and a total of 1732 outpatient visits for RD were reported. Heatwaves increased the frequency of RD outpatient visits and the highest RR of total RD was 1.155% and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) was 1.084-1.232 at Lag 0. For subcategories, heatwaves increased the risk of infectious RD (Lag 0: RR =1.182, 95% CI: 1.106-1.263) and decreased the risk of non-infectious RD ((Lag 6: RR =0.750, 95% CI: 0.568-0.990). Moreover, heatwaves showed adverse effects on acute upper respiratory infection (Lag 0: RR =1.306, 95% CI: 1.177-1.450). The RR of outpatient visits for RD was statistically significant in females (Lag 0: RR =1.161, 95% CI: 1.046-1.298), males (Lag 4: RR =1.161, 95% CI: 1.096-1.261), young people aged 4-17 years (Lag 0: RR =1.741, 95% CI: 1.524-1.990) and elders aged 65 years or older (Lag 5: RR =1.412, 95% CI: 1.111-1.794) during heatwaves. CONCLUSIONS: Heatwaves had a significant harmful impact on daily outpatient visits for RD in Cangnan, especially for vulnerable population identified. These results can be used not only to strengthen the health education and protection of these vulnerable populations, but also to assist relevant organizations with developing intervention programmes and improving disease prevention and community care.","Zhang, Anran     Hu, Wenqi     Li, Jiawei     Wei, Ran     Lin, Junfen     Ma, Wei     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2018/11/23     Environ Res. 2019 Feb;169:196-205. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2018.10.034.

Methods: Distributed lag models were used to estimate associations between the 2011 heat wave and all-cause mortality and emergency department (ED) visits from May 1 through September 30 for the five-year period 2007-2011. The 2011 heat wave is defined as a continuous period from August 2 through 30, 2011 according to the heat advisories issued by the local National Weather Service office, and is included in the models as a dummy variable. We compared the estimated excess risk among the models with and without adjustment of continuous temperature and ozone. Results: The 2011 heat wave in Houston was associated with a 3.6% excess risk in ED visits (95% CI: 0.6%, 6.6%) and 0.6% increase in mortality risk (95% CI: -5.5%, 7.1%).

Methods: Daily AECOPD hospitalizations and Meteorological data in Beijing were obtained between 2013 and 2016. Distributed lag non-linear model was adopted to investigate the association between daily ambient temperature and AECOPD hospitalizations. The cumulative effects of cold/hot temperature were abstracted. For the extreme and moderate low-temperature effect estimates, we, respectively, computed the RR of AECOPD hospitalizations at the 1st and 10th percentiles of temperature in comparison with that at the 25th percentile of temperature. For the extreme and moderate high temperature effect estimates, we, respectively, computed the RR of AECOPD hospitalizations at the 99th and 90th percentiles of temperature in comparison with that at the 75th percentile of temperature. Results: During the study period, 143, 318 AECOPD hospitalizations were collected. A reverse J-shape relationship was found between temperature and AECOPD hospitalizations. When comparing the effect of Tmean, higher RRs were associated with increases in AT on AECOPD hospitalizations but a lower value of Akaike's Information Criterion for quasi-Poisson (Q-AIC). The RR of extremely low temperature of Tmean and AT were 1.55 (95% CI: 1.21,2.00) and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.44,3.01), respectively. Moderate low temperature also had an adverse impact on AECOPD hospitalizations. No associations were found between high temperature and AECOPD risk.

SETTING: Patients and matched community controls were interviewed to gather data on demographics, living environment, social support, health status and behaviour changes during the heatwave. PARTICIPANTS: Cases were all hospital admissions with heat-related diagnoses during the 5-day heatwave in 2009. Controls were randomly selected from communities. OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive analyses, simple and multiple conditional logistic regressions were performed. Adjusted ORs (AORs) were estimated. RESULTS: In total, 143 hospital patients and 143 matched community controls were interviewed, with a mean age of 73 years (SD 21), 96% European ethnicity, 63% retired, 36% with high school or higher education, and 8% institutional living.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) affect millions of individuals and represent substantial health burdens in the US. High temperature may be a risk factor for AD/ADRD outcomes with several recent studies reporting associations between temperature and AD mortality. However, the link between heat and AD morbidity is poorly understood.Methods: We examined short-term associations between warm-season daily ambient temperature and AD/ADRD emergency department (ED) visits for individuals aged 45 years or above during the warm season (May to October) for up to 14 years (2005-2018) in five US states: California, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York. Daily ZIP code-level maximum, average and minimum temperature exposures were derived from 1 km gridded Daymet products. Associations are assessed using a time-stratified case-crossover design using conditional logistic regression.Results: We found consistent positive short-term effects of ambient temperature among 3.4 million AD/ADRD ED visits across five states. An increase of the 3-day cumulative temperature exposure of daily average temperature from the 50th to the 95th percentile was associated with a pooled odds ratio of 1.042 (95% CI: 1.034, 1.051) for AD/ADRD ED visits. We observed evidence of the association being stronger for patients 65-74 years of age and for ED visits that led to hospital admissions. Temperature associations were also stronger among AD/ADRD ED visits compared to ED visits for other reasons, particularly among patients aged 65-74 years.Conclusion: People with AD/ADRD may represent a vulnerable population affected by short-term exposure to high temperature. Our results support the development of targeted strategies to reduce heat-related AD/ADRD morbidity in the context of global warming.","Zhang, Yuzi     Ebelt, Stefanie T     Shi, Liuhua     Scovronick, Noah C     D'Souza, Rohan R     Steenland, Kyle     Chang, Howard H     eng     R01 AG074357/AG/NIA NIH HHS/     R01 ES027892/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     R21 ES032606/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Netherlands     2022/12/31     Environ Res. 2023 Mar 1;220:115176. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.115176.

We quantified the heatwave-hospitalization association in Brazil during 2000-2015. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Daily data on hospitalization and temperature were collected from 1,814 cities (>78% of the national population) in the hottest five consecutive months during 2000-2015. Twelve types of heatwaves were defined with daily mean temperatures of >=90th, 92.5th, 95th, or 97.5th percentiles of year-round temperature and durations of >=2, 3, or 4 consecutive days. The city-specific association was estimated using a quasi-Poisson regression with constrained distributed lag model and then pooled at the national level using random-effect meta-analysis. Stratified analyses were performed by five regions, sex, 10 age groups, and nine cause categories. The temporal change in the heatwave-hospitalization association was assessed using a time-varying constrained distributed lag model. Of the 58,400,682 hospitalizations (59% women), 24%, 34%, 21%, and 19% of cases were aged <20, 20-39, 40-59, and >=60 years, respectively. The city-specific year-round daily mean temperatures were 23.5 +/- 2.8 degreeC on average, varying from 26.8 +/- 1.8 degreeC for the 90th percentile to 28.0 +/- 1.6 degreeC for the 97.5th percentile. We observed that the risk of hospitalization was most pronounced for heatwaves characterized by high daily temperatures and long durations across Brazil, except for the minimal association in the north (the hottest region). After controlling for temperature, the association remained for severe heatwaves in the south and southeast (cold regions). Children 0-9 years, the elderly >=70 years, and admissions for perinatal conditions were most strongly associated with heatwaves. Over the study period, the strength of the heatwave-hospitalization association declined substantially in the south, while an apparent increase was observed in the southeast. The main limitations of this study included the lack of data on individual temperature exposure and measured air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: There are geographic, demographic, cause-specific, and temporal variations in the heatwave-hospitalization associations across the Brazilian population. Considering the projected increase in frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves, future strategies should be developed, such as building early warning systems, to reduce the health risk associated with heatwaves in Brazil.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002753,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;*Air Pollution/ae [Adverse Effects];Brazil/ep [Epidemiology];Cities/ep [Epidemiology];*Environmental Exposure/ae [Adverse Effects];Female;*Hospitalization/td [Trends];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;*Interrupted Time Series Analysis/td [Trends];Male;Middle Aged;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Young Adult;Brazil,,

However, limited data are available on nonfatal health outcomes, such as emergency department visits (EDVs), particularly from China. Objectives To examine the temperature-EDV association in 12 Chinese cities; and to assess the modification effects by region, gender and age. Methods Daily meteorological data and non-accidental EDVs were collected during 2011–2014. Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was applied to examine the temperature-lag-EDV association in each city. The effect estimates were pooled using multivariate meta-analysis at the national and regional level. Stratified analyses were performed by gender and age-groups. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for air pollution and relative humidity were conducted. Results A total of 4,443,127 EDVs were collected from the 12 cities. Both cold and hot temperatures were associated with increased risk of EDVs, with minimum-mortality temperature located at 64th percentile of temperature. The effect of cold temperature appeared on day 2 and persisted until day 30, causing a cumulative relative risk (RR) of 1.80 (1.54, 2.11). The effect of hot temperature appeared immediately and lasted until day 3, with a cumulative RR of 1.15 (1.03, 1.29). The effect of temperature on EDVs was similar in male and female but was attenuated with increasing age. The effect of cold temperature on EDVs was greater in southern areas of the country whereas the hot effect was greater in northern cities. The association was robust to a large range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In China, there is a U-shaped association between temperature and risk of EDVs that is independent of air pollution and humidity. The temperature-EDV association varies with latitude and age-groups but is not affected by gender. Forecasting models for hospital emergency departments may be improved if temperature is included as an independent predictor.","Zhao, Qi     Zhang, Yongming     Zhang, Wenyi     Li, Shanshan     Chen, Gongbo     Wu, Yanbin     Qiu, Chen     Ying, Kejing     Tang, Huaping     Huang, Jian-An     Williams, Gail     Huxley, Rachel     Guo, Yuming     eng     England     2017/02/23     Environ Pollut. 2017 May;224:310-316. doi: 10.1016/j.envpol.2017.02.010.

As a result, daily mean temperature exposure and early spontaneous abortion showed a nonlinear relationship in 14-day lag periods. Moreover, taking the median temperature (17 degreeC) as a reference, gradually increased positive effects of high temperature on spontaneous abortion could be found during the 4 days prior to hospitalization, and the highest odds ratio (OR) of 2.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36, 3.16) at extremely hot temperature (33 degreeC) was observed at 1 lag day.

However, few studies have assessed the morbidity burdens of various respiratory diseases that are attributable to different temperature ranges in subtropical regions. Methods Daily outpatient visits, weather variables, and air pollution data were collected from January 2013 to August 2017 in a hospital in Dongguan city. A standard time series quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to estimate the associations between daily mean temperature and morbidity for total respiratory diseases, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma. Attributable fractions were then calculated to quantify disease burden relative to different temperature components. Finally, we conducted stratified analysis by age group. Results Both low and high temperatures were associated with an increased risk of morbidity secondary to respiratory diseases. Compared with the optimum temperature, the accumulated relative risk (RR) during the seven lag days was 1.13 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.01-1.26 for extreme heat and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.99-1.05) for extreme cold. Heat-related respiratory morbidity risk was higher than cold-related risk for the total population, but an opposite result was observed for the elderly. About 8.4% (95% CI: 2.8-13.3%) of respiratory morbidity was attributable to non-optimal temperatures, and moderate heat was responsible for most of the excess respiratory morbidity (7.5, 95% CI: 2.4-12.2%).

From January 2017 to December 2021, a total of 8730 cases of TB were reported, with the higher incidence of male than that of female. When temperature was below 1 degreeC, it was significantly correlated with TB incidence compared to the median observed temperature (15 degreeC) at lag 7, 14, and 21, and lower temperatures showed larger RR (relative risk) values. High temperature produced a protective effect on TB transmission, and higher temperature from 16 to 31 degreeC has lower RR. In discussion stratified by gender, the maximum RRs were achieved for both male group and female group at - 15 degreeC with lag 21, reporting 4.28 and 2.02, respectively. At high temperature (higher than 20 degreeC), the RR value of developing TB for female group was significantly larger than 1. In discussion stratified by age, the maximum RRs were achieved for all age groups (<= 35, 36-64, >= 65) at - 15 degreeC with lag 21, reporting 3.20, 2.07, and 3.45, respectively. When the temperature was higher than 20 degreeC, the RR of the 36-64-year-old group and the >= 65-year-old group was significantly larger than 1 at lag 21, while significantly smaller than 1 for cumulative RR at lag 21, reporting 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.01, 0.83) and 0.06, 95% CI (0.01, 0.44), respectively. In conclusion, low temperature, especially in extreme level, acts as a high-risk factor inducing TB transmission in Kashgar city. Males exhibit a significantly higher RR of developing TB at low temperature than female, as well as the elderly group in contrast to the young or middle-aged groups. High temperature has a protective effect on TB transmission in the total population, but female and middle-aged and elderly groups are also required to be alert to the delayed RR induced by it.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.1007/s11356-022-22849-5,Aged;Middle Aged;Humans;Male;Female;Adult;Temperature;Incidence;*Nonlinear Dynamics;Risk Factors;Tuberculosis/ep [Epidemiology];*Tuberculosis;China/ep [Epidemiology];Fever;Nonlinear Dynamics;Linear Models;China,,

Moreover, few studies have reported the effect modification by individual characteristics on heat-related stroke mortality. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of heat exposure on total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke mortality and its individual modifiers in 12 cities in Jiangsu Province, China during 2009 to 2013. METHODS: We first used a distributed lag non-linear model with quasi-Poisson regression to examine the city-specific heat-related total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke mortality risks at 99th percentile vs. 75th percentile of daily mean temperature in the whole year for each city, while adjusting for long-term trend, season, relative humidity, and day of the week. Then, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the city-specific risk estimates. We also considered confounding by air pollution and effect modification by gender, age, education level, and death location. RESULTS: Overall, the heat-related mortality risk in 12 Jiangsu cities was 1.54 (95%CI: 1.44 to 1.65) for total stroke, 1.63 (95%CI: 1.48 to 1.80) for ischemic stroke, and 1.36 (95%CI: 1.26 to 1.48) for hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Estimated total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke mortality risks were higher for women versus men, older people versus younger people, those with low education levels versus high education levels, and deaths that occurred outside of hospital. Air pollutants did not significantly influence the heat-related stroke mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Heat exposure significantly increased both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke mortality risks in Jiangsu Province, China. Females, the elderly, and those with low education levels are particularly vulnerable to this effect.","Zhou, Lian     Chen, Kai     Chen, Xiaodong     Jing, Yuanshu     Ma, Zongwei     Bi, Jun     Kinney, Patrick L     eng     Meta-Analysis     Netherlands     2017/05/31     Sci Total Environ. 2017 Dec 1;601-602:271-277. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.169.

Owing to the aging population and high prevalence of stroke, East Asia might suffer a disproportionately heavy burden of stroke under the changing climate. However, the evidence relevant is still limited in this area. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stroke mortality risk due to heat exposure in East Asia and predict its burden under various future climate change scenarios. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center observational study and collected data from 22 representative cities in three main East Asian countries (i.e., China, Japan, and South Korea) from 1972 to 2015. The two-stage time-series analyses were applied to estimate the effects of heat on stroke mortality at the regional and country level. We further projected the burden of heat-related stroke mortality using 10 global climate models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway (SSP-RCP) scenarios, including SSP1-RCP1.9, SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5 scenarios. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 287,579 stroke deaths were collected during the warm season. Heat was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke mortality. Overall, compared with the 2010 s, the heat-related attributable fraction (AF) was projected to increase in the 2090 s, with increments ranging from 0.8 % to 7.5 % across various climate change scenarios. The heat-related AF was projected to reach 11.9 % (95 % empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 6.1 %, 17.5 %) in the 2090 s under the SSP5-RCP8.5 scenario in China, while the corresponding estimates were 6.6 % (95 % eCI: 2.5 %, 11.0 %) and 5.1 % (95 % eCI: 1.2 %, 9.1 %) for Japan and South Korea, respectively.

METHODS: We investigated the short-term association between daily temperature and physician-diagnosed infectious diarrhea during 2008-2010 in Shanghai, China. We adopted a time-series approach to analyze the data and a quasi-Poisson regression model with a natural spline-smoothing function to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, as well as other time-varying covariates. RESULTS: There was a significant association between temperature and outpatient visits for diarrhea. A 1degreeC increase in the 6-day moving average of temperature was associated with a 2.68% (95% CI: 1.83%, 3.52%) increase in outpatient visits for diarrhea. We did not find a significant association between rainfall and infectious diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: High temperature might be a risk factor for infectious diarrhea in Shanghai. Public health programs should focus on preventing diarrhea related to high temperature among city residents.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Jennifer,10.2188/jea.je20130012,Adult;*Ambulatory Care/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data];Child;China/ep [Epidemiology];*Dysentery/di [Diagnosis];Dysentery/ep [Epidemiology];*Hot Temperature/ae [Adverse Effects];Humans;Risk Factors;Time Factors;Diarrhea;Temperature;China,,
